New boys at Grenfell Wealdon Associates should always try to indulge the whims of their now co-workers, but this was going a bit far, he thought. He pounded, away, on the treadmill, sweat pouring, off him, his heart, in his, throat.... Graham thrashing him at squash had felt like the limit; now he and Damien seemed to be hoping to finish Martin off, with a stint in the gym that was starting to feel less like a stint and more like the thirteenth labour of Hercules.\nHis mind wandered, or maybe his life was flashing before his eyes. He remembered reading about Heathcliff covering 30 miles in a day. OK, so he'd been walking at a steady pace; but still, that was more impressive than the, ah, three that Martin has so far managed. As he saw  out of the corner of one eye Damien moving like The Flash, Martin wondered if maybe one day, he'd be that fast, that this job might be the making of him. \"The right applicant could go far.\" \n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/13303.html"},{"title":"#-14","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    15 Jul 2007        \n        \n\nOn especially cold days they didn't even open the curtains. The landlord had let the frames shrink in the elements these past few years, and if given its freedom an otherwise imperceptible draught would gradually chill the room. That year was so cold that, in mid-January, she taped the edges of the curtains to the wall.\nLater that month they both took the last of their year's holidays as the temperatures sank inexorably towards a record level. They stayed in the house for a week, fridge and freezer full and switched off and outside on the porch, snow piling up around the house and up the steps.\nThey made a nest out of quilts and listened to the radio, always holding their smoky breath during the weather: minus ten, minus twelve, minus... fourteen. As the season sat at its turning point they ate chocolate, wore scarves and told stories from when they were young.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/14.html"},{"title":"#46","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    17 Jun 2007        \n        \n\nThe radio blared across a room full of hard things, over the sounds of an electric screwdriver and a set of pistons, and into the street. From where he was stationed by one of the Victorian arches that constituted the front of the garage, Bryono (Brian to his mother) could just make out something by Duran Duran.\nBryono was bouncing waste tyres down the pavement, towards the skip where Mickie-Rickie (Michael) fielded them, swooping them onto the existing pile. As they stumbled and jogged along, the tyres defined some sort of game that Bryono didn't know the rules to, but because it felt like it was for kids then that didn't matter. The fun was in the playing.\n\"Forty-six,\" Mickie-Rickie said, and Bryono was startled.\n\"What?\"\n\"Forty-six. That's the load for today.\"\nAnd suddenly Bryono was sad, because it had stopped being a kid's game. It isn't really a kid's game if someone is keeping score.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/46.html"},{"title":"#5","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    17 Jul 2007        \n        \n\nHe gave me my first driving lesson, of a sort. To this day I don't know whether he saw it as a necessary chore, a good deed to cement our odd friendship; whether instead it came from a genuine urge to teach. Surrounded by teachers all day (even ones as mediocre as those at the school) he was bound to have inhaled some of that paedagogical spirit.\nThe inside of his Morris Minor smelt of hot leather, sweat and peppermints. Whenever I smell anything approaching that combination now—only ever two of those three at best—I can hear him saying: \"There're four gears, and reverse, and this lever here is the handbrake, which is how you stop, only after you've stopped.\" And in my mind, clear and insistent as the school bell, are the words: \"Four plus reverse makes five, not four.\" But at the time I kept quiet and nodded, soaking it all up.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/5.html"},{"title":"#5.25","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    9 Nov 2008        \n        \n\nHe put the bible down on his bedside table, and ran his hand over his bald patch. The frown on his face said: this is harder than I thought. When he had been a child it had been so much simpler—and shorter—with six days meaning six days, and forty nights, forty nights.\nStill, he must have got at least two thirds through it, which was as far as he was concerned an achievement. He'd just been reading about the writing on the wall (was that where it came from? he wondered) and wasn't at all sure about that Daniel. At least the king had known how to hold a party for his friends; Daniel, he thought, was a bit of a prig.\nStill, page eight hundred and something.  Three hundred to go. Without Jackie around in the evenings, clamouring for his attention, he was bound to get to the end in no time.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/525.html"},{"title":"#60","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    9 Nov 2008        \n        \n\n\"Guys: check it out!\" the kid shoulted over the roar of the open window. Tinny hip-hop clattered down the bus towards the driver.\nAnother kid snatched the phone from the outstretched hand of the first, faster than you could blink. \"Robbish, Mickey! Fockin robbish!\" he laughed, and feinted away from his mate's attempts to get the phone back.\nIts owner suddenly had a spurt of energy, swiped the phone from his tormentor and dropped back into his seat. But as he flopped down he lost hold of the phone, which arced away and seemed to hover briefly in mid-air; then it was out of the open window and rapidly receding. The bus had reached the A-road and sixty miles per hour, and would not relent until the next town.\n\"Roffle!\" all the kids jeered. \"Roffle!\" \n  ","href":"article/60.html"},{"title":"#75","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    24 Jun 2007        \n        \n\n\"I look at her, and then look down at my shoes, and I think she's doing the same. Then she hands me a note. It's folded over once, and it's all yellow, like that posh stuff, vellum or something. I take it and look back up at her. She's so pretty.... Then, slowly like, I unfold the note... and I can't remember a word of it now.\n\"I think I must be in love with her. In my head I go over the bit where I look up at her, then down at my shoes—they're brown; is that a clue? How long ago did men last wear brown leather shoes? What year is this?—and every time that my head tilts back up to look at her my stomach flips. Like that bit when a plane, you know, an aeroplane, when it lurched just before landing. Over and over. Over and out. I adore her. Mad about her.\n\"Girlfriend? Maybe, yes. How old am I? I can't tell. In my mind, I'm twenty and then suddenly seventy-five. But I'm still looking at her. I'm still in love.\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/75.html"},{"title":"#8","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    10 Jul 2007        \n        \n\nAs he was starting on his third satsuma, he suddenly decided that, if he could remove its peel entirely in one single spiral of plucked flesh, then everything would work out how he wanted it to. He used to do that all the time as a child: gauge when a menial task or everyday happening could be made sufficiently complex and arduous that it might form the cosmic mirror image of some desired benefit. A benefit that otherwise was logically out of his reach.\nWhen they were both eight, he and his sister shared her secret, that if one stood on any of the cracks in the pavement between school and home, one was eaten immediately by bears. But Nigel would base his games on positive outcomes instead: if he trod on the stones and not the gaps between them then he'd get full marks on a test, or Dad would come home, or there'd be more pocket money. So, with the room already stinking of orange, gingerly, precisely, holding his breath—he began to peel.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/8.html"},{"title":"#9:02","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    24 Jun 2007        \n        \n\nHis body (solid, running to fat) occupies the folds of tatty, oil-stained work clothes. It rolls up inside the brown slacks and strains the blue fabric of his shirt into a series of gapes. His face is normally a whole mess of folds: cheek against jowl, nose against eyebrow, eye squinting at a latheing job.\nToday, though, surprise and apprehension sit on his eyes, and iron flat his frown. His pudgy fingers have begun to fold around the letter the foreman is handing him, the letter they have all been dreading; they curl like bananas around the envelope, which begins to bend and crumple. It has only just turned nine o'clock, he thinks: the working day has barely begun; my working life is over.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/902.html"},{"title":"Age shall not weary them","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    6 Mar 2007        \n        \n\nFrom a distance the two figures looked stationary on the landscape. Their pastel colours and gently blurred edges seemed to be attacked from all sides by the rugged, red landscape. The wind, though quiet, scarified every surface it touched by carrying with it a thin essence of fine, sharp sand. Light though it was the drifting breeze was surely to scratch and blast the twain into an even finer powder. They stood, turned towards their own destruction: two delicate flowers planted in unsuitable soil and doomed to die.\nYet they continued as though the wind were nothing. Each picked its way in an apelike manner across the inhospitable hillside. Were any other living creature close enough, it might see that the taller figure (dressed in various shades of twilight blue) consulting some hand-held device as he proceeded slowly, cautiously, across gravel and unstable, flat rocks. The shorter figure trod close to the footsteps of the taller, attempting but not always making the sometimes necessarily long jumps from safety to safety.\nEvery few dozen paces the leader would turn back to his companion and they would exchange a few short noises. It was impossible to see the sources of speech through the helmets they wore, opaque and matt surfaces smoothing out any internal detail. Even close to the pair (and surely nothing was so close as to hear) the sounds carried only emotion in clarity: occasional interest, expectations fulfilled, a growing impatience and desire to be back... somewhere. The muffled sound did not seem to carry whatever fuller, richer meaning there was passing between them; that travelled by some other invisible route. The shorter of the two pointed something out, that they should head towards; the taller, reluctantly, agreed.\n\"Going out again?\"\nKallum was slopping his way through some sort of gruel, and as he asked the question some droppped off his spoon into the bowl with a splat. Mak looked faintly disgusted at him. Kallum would eat anything, but some of the lumps in that stuff defied swallowing as far as Mak was concerned.\n\"Ella needs more samples.\" \nKallum shrugged, said: \"You'd think we'd have enough for the report by now,\" and turned his attention back to his spoon.\n\"You know what she's like. Nothing's ever finished.\"\nKallum nodded, agreeing. \"She won't stop. Not until she's actually submitted the report,\" he said, \"and even then it has to be signed off before she'll stop re-analysing, and arguments over possible additions, back and forth over the eeth' until she has to use her personal credit, and even then riders inserted to the conclusions, footnotes, new citates.... We'll be sending supps and addends for months afterwards, mark my words.\" And he carried on slurping at his dinner.\nA bit unfair, Mak thought. \"Well, what we've got now is inconclusive, I suppose. We only had a handful of data from up on the third ridge....\" Mak tailed off, grimly fascinated. \"Chrypst, Kallum!\" he finally cried. \"We're in an env-station, not prison. Can't you find something else you like in the stores?\"\nLooking put out, Kallum glanced down at his food, then back up at Mak. \"I was aiming for something fairly plain. But... I suppose it could do with some salt. Maybe.... Any in the cupboards?\" Mak started to shake his head, eyes still fixed on Kallum. \"Actually,\" Kallum started trying to sound urbane: \"I knew it was missing a little, you know, something.\"\nMak raised his eyes, looking up towards the planet's surface, shifted his chair back, got up and walked out of the room, all without replying.\n\"OK, OK!\" Kallum called after him. \"A bit of pepper as well!\"\nThe scenery had changed gradually as they had travelled along and down the hill. Now, still a few hundred metres from its foot, they were encountering great boulders set upon gritty, compacted sandstone. Occasional, steep slopes of loose sand punctuated the makeshift trail they were following, and they would have to detour to avoid them. This was hardly a simple procedure, as the ground on the hill-side of the trail was a metre or two higher than that on the valley-side,  bristling and ribbed with geological strata and imperfections—features that Josi had no doubt catalogued—so it was sometimes necessary to clamber up onto the ridge, walk along a few metres, then drop back onto the path that resumed beyond the subsidence. It took time.\nMak, still in front, shook the device in his hands. He looked intently at it, as if listening for a rattling screw. Then he actually did prick up his ears, and put a hand out behind him, palm towards Ella. They both stood still.\n\"I thought I heard stones rattling,\" he said uncertainly.\n\"Well, yes, Mak,\" Ella replied. \"We've been kicking them up all the way down. Some have probably got ahead of us.\"\nMak nodded. \"You're probably right,\" he said.\nHe made his way round a particularly misshapen chunk of the natural wall, with dark recesses here and there, shelters from the hot sun. There was less than five metres separating him and Ella, when into that space leapt a straggly, shapeless form, bundling itself out of one of the larger caves. It whirled as if to stare at each of them in turn, in a panicked flurry of fibres, cloth and straggly hair. Mak caught a glimpse of the whites of two frightened eyes peering out of a wrinkled, dirty once-face, before the creature made a snap decision and tried to bolt between Ella and the wall. But there wasn't enough room for it to pass, and its flank slapped against Ella. Her suit threw off sparks as she stumbled away from her attacker.\n\"Mak!\" she cried, staggering at the edge of a sandy scarp; as he moved to grab a hand, a wrist, anything, she was already gone, a cloud of dust all that remained. Two seconds passed as Mak dithered, listening to the sound of her tumbling away, already almost inaudible; then he swallowed, and jumped.\nThe hillside was steep as a buttress, and it was all Mak could do to keep his legs ahead of his head. Every bump he felt was, he knew, soaked up in part by the suit. All around him he could see it turning first blue, then cyan, turquoise. Only when it had definitely gone green could he see Ella a few metres below and to the side: luckily he hadn't been kicking rocks down at her as he'd followed.\nHer suit, he saw, had tried to help much as his had, but was now in a far worse state: a sickly unripe yellow. Mak tried not to wonder what that impled about what she had hit on the way down. He couldn't see her skin's own hue through the visor, of course, but it was clear from the way that she was lying that she wasn't conscious.\nMak reached for the radio on his belt, but his hand passed through air to his side. He looked to Ella's radio: smashed. Mak's was either still at the top of the slope, or buried under the small landslide that had pursued them both on their way down. So, he thought. Just us. Well, just me, right now. He wondered if she was badly hurt.\nHer suit would know. There was a small panel on the side of her helmet, which lifted to reveal a few buttons and a basic screen: he touched one control and the screen woke up, undamaged by the descent. He touched another and her visor became translucent: still that eerie colour, but at least he could see her face now. She looked like she was only asleep. He turned back to the helmet's computer. She was still breathing and nothing obvious was broken, bruises (he read off the displays) on her head and limbs, but... no evidence of concussion or internal injuries.\nAs he pushed one last button, a little too hard, to close the panel, Ella's eyelids flickered and she groaned some sort of complaint at her head being moved. When he heard her, Mak felt like he was waking up too; he realised he hadn't breathed out for a  good twenty seconds, and did so.\nThey were suiting up in the foyer, by a row of lockers meant for a much larger crew than the skeleton force that the station currently housed. Boots were seamed to trousers; trousers to tops; tops zipped up to the neck and down to the wrists, where gloves, as with the other clothes, merged their fibres quietly and without fuss into the sleeves. Ella was floundering, looking round for something.\n\"What is it?\" Mak asked.\nShe clicked her fingers. \"Thing,\" she said, still looking.\n\"Thing?\"\nShe stopped, and looked at Mak. \"Radio. I knew I had it with me when I left quarters. I put it down somewhere and now I-\"\nMak was already holding it out towards her, giving her a look. She returned it, taking the smooth capsule of electronics from his outstretched hand. \"Thanks,\" she eventually said.\nBrief as the moment was, it was still possible for the airlock to interrupt it. Behind them the heavy doors began to hiss and wheeze, and crackle with electrical connections made and then lost; the cameras either side of the entrance showed a weirdly cartoon woman in the shelter of the porch beyond, a rounded, feminine body in what looked like a peach-coloured jumpsuit and helmet. A few seconds later the doors themselves revealed the same image, only the woman now walked out of the frame and towards Mak and Ella.\n\"Josi!\" Ella cried. \"Orange! Levels nearly down to zero! What in the world...?\"\nJosi raised a hand in admonition. \"Don't start, Ella,\" she mumbled, her voice muffled by the visor, and moved over to her locker. She fiddled with buttons by the thin plate covering over her temple.  There was a sucking noise, and the almost uniform colour seemed to peel upwards into the mechanism surrounding the plate. Underneath it Josi's clothes were a range of more natural shades. She lifted her helmet off and breathed and whoofed a couple of times.\n\"Look, I didn't mean to, but-\"\nBut Ella interrupted: \"You've been out all night again, haven't you?\"\nJosi just nodded, and looked from Ella to Mak and back, daring them to judge. She'd just wanted to see the stars. She always just wanted to see the stars. \n\"Anyway,\" Josi said eventually, getting flustered, \"Kallum will need help with the spectro. I should go and do that.\" Then, angry at herself, and angrier still at being caught, Josi almost fled from the room, somehow managing to make the automatic door slam behind her. Mak and Ella looked at each other, and both almost simultaneously shrugged, then grinned.\n\"Ready?\" Mak asked.\nElla nodded. \"Yep. Let's go kick some!\"\nAs if on cue they both turned round for their helmets, and as one reached up to click the switch at the temple. A pop and a fizz, and a haze of dark purple flowed like water down to their feet, wrapping round their limbs and tightening until it was a second skin.\nElla was leaning against a rounded boulder, perhaps two-thirds as tall as she was. She was flexing each bit in turn, especially her ankle and wrist, both of which she'd managed to twist.\n\"Lucky,\" she said, shaking her head. Mak looked up. \"I was lucky.\"\nHe smiled thinly. \"If you'd been lucky you'd still be up there,\" he countered, pointing up the hill. She smiled back, then looked out over the valley, to the bottom of which they now found themselves much closer. Without meaning to, Ella caught herself looking for something. She wondered aloud: \"Where do you think she is now? That woman, I mean. She'd probably still be running if she could. All the way to Monte Vieko and the stream. That's where I'd go....\" She tailed off, seeing Mak staring at her.\n\"She...?\" Mak exclaimed. \"You mean... that was human? With hair down to....\" Mak drew a level with his hand, then realised it wasn't close enough to the ground, and indicated it again. \"Down to here?\"\nElla just nodded. Mak thought for a while, gasping and hmfing now and then.\n\"But...\" he said finally, \"it must have... she must have been five hundred years old.  The wrinkles on her. The hair on her. The eyes on her.\"\nElla tilted her head to one side a little, resignedly, then found that that hurt a bit and straightened her neck. \"Mak, use your loafer. Look at your suit.\"\nHis jaw gaped for a second, and then he looked down. \"OK.\" He made a show of examining it. \"This colour is disgusting, and doesn't do me any favours at all.\"\nThey both laughed; Ella gradually turned hers into: \"no, no, Mak: look closely. Keep watching.\"\nObediently Mak looked back at his own body, and waited. After a few seconds, there was a spark from his lower thigh, and then a second later another near his collarbone.\n\"Well, yeah. Rays. So what? The post-burn pollutants. Or am I missing something? We've had zaps and foofs from our suits all day, except when we were in the lee of Teylor's Scarps....\" He tailed off. \"Of course. Pollutants.\" He swallowed. \"She didn't have a suit.\"\nElla nodded. \"She was probably eighty. Eighty-five, at most. Eighty-five years wandering round in this poison.\"\nHis mouth hung open, and then: \"Gott. She was probably crazy too, from the rays. No wonder she looked such a mess.\" He had a brief memory of all that tangled hair again and shuddered. \"No wonder she bolted like that too. I suppose to her I must have looked pretty weird.\"\n\"Whereas to everyone else you look absolutely normal, like, all the time.\"\n\"Well,\" he said, patting imaginary dust off his thighs and making as if to go, \"you certainly sound like you've pretty much recovered from your terrible ordeal. Practically back to normal, in fact.\" He looked hard at her, to make sure the joke was really true. \"You ready? Reckon you'll make it back to the station OK?\"\nElla made a gesture with her hand to say, hold on, and then took a few experimental breaths. She paused for a second as if deep in thought, and then nodded, smiling. \"Never better.\"\nThey turned towards home, not so far now they'd cut a few hundred vertical metres and three circuitous horizontal kilometres off their journey. They were both quiet for the first half a mile or so, with their own thoughts. That had been close, they silently agreed. Ella noticed, though, that Mak kept looking across at her. Once or twice his mouth had worked, hard to spot even through the reduced shielding across his face.\nFinally he spoke: \"Hey, Ella.\"\n\"Uh-huh?\"\nMak chewed on his words a few seconds, and then said: \"Don't you be going out without your suit.\"\nShe stopped, and turned towards him. Through her visor he saw her smile. \"Whyever would I, hm?\" she asked.\nMak shrugged. \"I... that is, the team here... that is, I'd like to have you around for a good long while yet.\"\nBefore he knew it she'd slipped her hand in his, and they were trudging back towards the env-station again. Where their two shields met, they gave out a low, genial buzz. Mak tried not to look down, in case it hadn't really happened.\n\"Another five hundred years or so?\"\n\"Yeah, I guess. Only...\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"... Only  don't let yourself go. It'd be down to Kallum to get the knots out of your hair.\"\n\"Kallum? OK, you've convinced me. Manicure when I get back, OK?\"\nThey carried on walking in silence, still hand in hand as though it was the way they always came back from their trips outside. There'd be gossip, Ella thought briefly, once Josi spots them on the cameras. That was just fine with her. She pictured the two of them from Josi's point of view, rounding the corner by the env-station, quite obvious in their suits' lurid colours. Looking from herself to Mak and back, she saw all the silly soft-tone yellows and greens and blues, starting to swirl together as their shields shared power, the two of them deceptively strong against the powerless red rock.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/age-shall-not-weary-them.html"},{"title":"All flesh is grass","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    17 Jul 2005        \n        \n\nThat it was called a contract, Gavin mused, was no coincidence. As he thought of it, beyond the piece of paper lying inert in his filing upstairs to the thing in itself, he saw the agreement as something tightening around him, first a starched collar, then manacles, then stocks, then a noose. On the phone to Eleanor, friend since school, he made the mistake of confiding a fraction of this, and she replied:\n\"Gavin, come on. That's pathetic.\"\n\"Ellie!\" he whined. \"This is serious. I'm sure she can't demand this. There must be something in law about it. I should ring the CAB. You can't just put that sort of thing into print and assume the other party has no choice but to follow it to the letter.\"\n\"Well, if you get use of it, then maybe it's your responsibility.\"\n\"It's hers. She uses it more than I do.\"\n\"Look,\" she said, trying another tack. \"She's a seventy-five-year-old woman. Have some pity.\"\n\"Pity?\" \nThen another: \"All she wants you to do is cut the grass, you dickhead.\"\n\"Di-?\"\n\"Like you agreed when you moved in, you dickhead.\"\nThat worked. Gavin was about to repeat the first half-syllable of \"dickhead\", when he paused, and was lost. He had to agree, with his inner voice as much as with Eleanor, that he'd been happy to take on Mrs Fielden's \"jobs around the house\" in return for a rent comparable with council tax: the old woman had offered to pay his share of that too, but he hadn't had the heart.\nEleanor was talking again. \"You got a hell of a low rent out of the deal, so the least you can do is keep her garden tidy like you promised. Mow a bit of lawn. Yes?\"\n\"This isn't a bit of a lawn,\" he protested, a bit half-heartedly. \"It's a field. A prairie. It stretches all the way to Cheltenham.\"\n\"Well, you always said you wanted to see the world.\"\n\"Yeah, and I end up living in the middle of bloody nowhere to save a bit of cash. And being slave-driven by the mad old woman in the attic.\"\n\"Gavin! Mrs Fielden is lovely and you know it. She's redecorated your room and redone your bathroom since youv'e been there, and she always makes sure there's some parking for you and your mates. And you get a lovely view over the downs.\"\n\"Lovely view of my arse,\" Gavin mumbled back.\n\"Sorry, Gav. Crackle on the line just then. What was that?\"\n\"I said it'd be lovely to cut the grass; it'd be the least I could do. And I'd be able to see those rolling hills in the distance.\"\n\"Good boy.\"\nHe sighed. \"... So. How did it go with Jerome on Tuesday?\"\n\"... Shut up, you dickhead,\" Eleanor said, and they were off again.\nMrs Fielden was overjoyed. She hadn't wanted to say anything, but; and she knew how hard Gavin was working at work, it was just; and with spring around the corner, wouldn't it be lovely if; of course, the garden was his to enjoy as much as hers, and it'd be terribly nice of him if he could, and only if it would be no trouble, might he: tidy it up a little? If Gavin hadn't already been convinced by Eleanor that he was performing a charitable act by trundling a mower over Mrs Fielden's plot of land, the way that the old woman reacted would have been enough in itself: a charming willingness on her part to be charmed by the smallest favour.\nAt least she had a nice new(ish) electrical machine. He'd heard tales of horror from her about the old petrol-driven beast pushed around years ago by Mr Holden. He had once been Farmer Holden, you know, and Mrs Fielden's sweetheart, but he'd fallen on hard times and helped with raising her flowerbeds if not her children, until out of the blue he'd inherited a tidy sum and move elsewhere, and after all was said and done it had still broken—but the end of Mrs Fielden's stories, like the end of her lawn, seemed always in sight but never to be attained. Anyway, after hearing about how it had once exploded sump oil in Mr Holden's face, or the starter rope had snapped and lashed across the old man's forehead, Gavin could only heap praises on the name of Mr Flymo and the wonders he had invented. If God had intended for humankind to spend hours every few weeks coaxing and cajoling instrument after recalcitrant instrument into the task of making his lawn bowling-green flat, he reckoned, He wouldn't have permitted the quick fix of a hover-mower. And He wouldn't have bothered to create anyone except the English, who thrived on such behaviour.\nIt was still mowing the lawn. Mowing the bloody lawn, Gavin thought. Mowing the bloody, buggering... Gavin, to make it sufficiently clear that we might move on, hated gardening. It was what he'd been made to do to earn his pocket money, or allowance, as his dad, his father had called it. Gavin's father had the Latinate to hand at all times, and forbade his son from watching Grange Hill, Byker Grove and Press Gang. Quite early on Father had decided that these were corrupting influences, and as the television was banished to the back room anyway it had been easy to keep Gavin from such perniciousness. Besides, that gave him more time for chores, and Father was sure that Gavin would be happy to help his mother out round the house as any decent son should. Father's emphasis.\n(Gavin's father, and his grandfather before him, had earned their allowances by doing odd jobs around the house, especially in the garden. Therefore, if he didn't mow the lawn, Gavin would inevitably, in some small way, never fully become his father. Now, though, it was too late.)\nHe tightened his grip on the lever under his hand. The machine whirred into life and he pushed it away from the house.\nThe first stripe was the worst. When the mower wasn't bogged down in the undergrowth of an unseasonably mild winter, it floated too airily and threatened to leave Gavin's control altogether. The earth underneath was fairly flat, but over-ambitious clumps of grass had toughened themselves into what had the feeling and weight of foam-wrapped housebricks. Every now and then Gavin was sure he heard the mower cough as if it were gagging on a bone.\nThree more stripes, and he began to build up momentum. For the first time he was able to look round at the rest of Mrs Fielden's garden—not nearly as far gone to seed—and see his own place in it. The shrubs hiding the two long fences, dotted with rhododendrons and other bizarre plants Gavin couldn't identify; the hedges sprouting out of the sides of the house, delineating the boundary between front and back; the fence at the far end of the garden, separating it from the fields beyond.... He saw in his mind's eye the boundaries like the rack of a canvas, and even if he weren't the painter, he was preparing it for the broad strokes of the summer's heat to spatter it with daisies and buttercups. That sounded good. \nHe tried to move with a little more dignity, as such a responsibility might demand. By now the early spring sunshine had strengthened a little, or maybe his blood had began to move; warmed and perspiring, he unbuttoned his shirt sleeves and rolled them up. Even better than a mock artist's assistant, now he felt like a proper gardener. This patch of grass was his realm and his responsibility, a patch of fuzzed-up baize that he was slowly, methodically, restoring to neatness and tidy prettiness.\nInto every summer's garden a little rain must fall, however, and it fell into Gavin's patch in the form of the far-from-dulcet tones of Mrs Frances Edmundson.\n\"Hello!\" called her voice over the roar of the machine. Gavin turned towards it, towards the fence and the next garden along, before he recognised the tone; had he done vice-versa, he might have pretended not to hear Mrs Edmundson, at least until he reached the end of the stripe and would have to turn towards her. By then she might have given up and gone wreaking elsewhere.\nWhen she first met Gavin, she'd been told by a slightly confused Mrs Fielden that the new lodger did something \"terribly important in the city\". So, with a well-oiled gear-change that only the best finishing schools provide, Mrs Edmundson had insisted that Gavin should call her Frances. But once she'd found out that he'd gone to a comprehensive school—and had been born north of Bedfordshire, for heaven's sake—she'd made it quite clear through intermediaries such as Mrs Fielden (not via anything so coarse as direct communication) that he had to call her Mrs Edmundson after all. Deep down knew he wasn't missing much, but it still stung.\nHe released the lever, and the mower's shout became a purr then a sudden choke. Forcing a polite smile, he said: \"Mrs Edmundson! Enjoying your garden?\" He noticed she was wearing some sort of out-of-doors hat, that looked ridiculously workmanlike on her horsey head but probably cost more than Mrs Fielden's mower. Head and hat both hovered over a rhododendron, and Gavin thought: no, not horsey. Waspish. Looking for a bit of sustenance and hoping that someone might get entertainingly stung.\nShe laughed what she probably thought was a tinkling laugh. It sounded to Gavin like pint glasses being thrown into a sink. \"One has it to do, of course. It would be a waste not to, really, especially on such a day as this. But I see you are enjoying yours, in your own way!\"\n\"One has it to do,\" Gavin replied before realising he was repeating her, but she didn't notice. \"I'm just happy to be helping out Mrs Fielden. She's been so kind to me since I moved out here.\" He had the decency to blush as he said this.\n\"Yes, well, I'm sure you are doing the best job you can with it all. Of course, it takes a real virtuoso to bring out the full potential of one's exterior spaces. I employed a landscaper to shape my borders, you know. I could not have sanctioned anyone who wasn't a professional tinkering in my garden.\"\n\"Really?\" asked Gavin, gritting his teeth.\n\"Oh yes, a fellow from Islington, of all places. Terribly bright, a bit of a dandy, if you ask me, and he was probably a... well, you know. These creative chaps. It isn't our place to judge, of course. But I have to confess that he worked wonders with my lobelia, and that's what counts, isn't it? When I think of all the years that Mrs Fielden let that blasted Holden ruin her perfectly decent garden. She could have done so much more with it. I'd have sacked the man on the spot if I'd seen him pruning like he pruned.\"\nGavin didn't know what to say. He knew about Mrs Fielden and Farmer Holden, and he knew from her little asides that Mrs Edmundson knew it too: if he could fill in the gaps then Mrs Edmundson could, and probably had. Poor Mrs Fielden, Gavin felt rather than thought, and held himself in check as he coughed out:\n\"Well, he did what he could.\"\nShe sniffed. \"I'm sure he did, but that's hardly the point, now, is it? If one doesn't excel, then it's not at all clear why one should really bother in the first place. Oh, but I'm keeping the worker from his task, aren't I? How foolish of me. I must let you get on, Gavin. You will let Mrs Fielden know I was asking after her, won't you?\"\nHe couldn't be sure, but he thought she'd stressed the word \"worker.\"  He smiled back, bit his cheek and then gunned the motor back into life. Only when the head and finally the hat had disappeared back behind the fence did he let his features crease into a black scowl, and began to push the mower with renewed vigour.\nMuttering under his breath he imagined bloody Frances bloody Edmundson pegged out among the nettles and dandelions, directly in the path of the bloody mower. Head going under first, but before that her bloody hat. He'd show what a worker could really do. Just you wait and see, Frances, he thought, aiming the words over the rhododendrons like a malevolent fly-tipping. He'd be the first person in the world to mow from here to Cheltenham. And beyond.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/all-flesh-grass.html"},{"title":"All articles","body":"\n    “Show me to write, man!” said Dean,\nBut: “let’s see America!” he meant.\nWe drove as far as San Francisco; Dean cleared out\nLeaving us without a cent.\nCamille and Marylou,\nAnd Inez he married, too.\nThough we’ll never ride together again,\nDean, I still think about you.\n  \n    Take me upriver, to Kurtz:\nI’ll find him, and help him, without fail.\nWe make our way past severed heads; then, look: it’s him!\nOn a stretcher, deathly pale.\nI can’t leave him behind:\nThough he’s found, he’s lost his mind;\nIf you stray beyond the ambit of sense,\nHorror! is all you will find.\n  \n    Show me the way to Mordor!\nI’m tired as I’m carrying the ring.\nI left the Fellowship with Sam a while ago,\nAnd now Gollum’s following.\nMeanwhile, there’s bloody war\nIn Helm’s Deep and Pelennor.\nWhen the ship arrives for us, then I’ll know:\nI’ll see the Shire nevermore.\n  \n    Stephen and Leopold wake,\nThen set off round Dublin, both on foot.\nAll day they wander, meet, then wander off again,\nTill the young man gets half-cut.\nIn Nighttown, in distress,\nStephen’s helped by Bloom, no less;\nStill, they’re home in time for Molly to dream:\n“yes I said yes I will Yes.”\n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    11 Mar 2011        \n        \n\nWee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie,\nO, how I wiss ye'd na been hasty!\nYe'd still be eatin pyles richt tasty\nAn' rinnin roun'.\nI'd then be laith tae scaith thee, mousie,\nLike some daft loun.\nI'm truly sorry man's unfeelin'\nDid nick thy life with wee, fley'd squeelin'.\nIt leaves my senses all a-creelin':\nWae's me!

He made fewer observations—he could conjure the stones both seen and unseen at will, which was more than the site itself could provide him with—and no experiments at all, so as not to raise suspicion.\n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    1 Mar 2008        \n        \n\nWeeks passed, and once he had overcome the initial shock of his parents' announcement, Rhys was able to work once again on the grand plans under his bed and in his head. With time no longer on his side he decided to take a notebook with him to the site and back.

Come in here a sec!\"\n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    17 Feb 2008        \n        \n\nThe impact of the front door on its frame shook the house; the noise made the panes of glass sing in the rickety window at the top of the stairs, and return to Rhys like the echo of a cry. Another day of wandering round, trying to be left alone, in vain. Every few steps Rhys would draw a bead from one stone to another, trying to lose himself in calculations, only to find either the line or his own body jostled by some gabbling pakamak.\n  ","href":"article/article.php?page=26&ref=01-09-23.html"},{"title":"All articles","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    14 Feb 2008        \n        \n\nRhys hated that there were always other people there.

It was clear from the other side of Wall Street that the display hadn't changed, and would probably have to gather dust until after Christmas. The jars of piccalilli never diminished, but then none of the piles on display seemed to.

One of her first memories was of gazing into a bauble at herself gazing back; the reflected face was speckled by a wintry scene, picked out in raised points of white paint. Every time she conjured up the memory it would unfold behind the decoration to encompass an enormous tinsel tree (unashamedly fake), hundreds of ornaments, tiny strings of lights hung from the branches and a tiny, Barbie-perfect fairy doll so far away from her toddler hands as to be in heaven with the angels.\n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    19 Jan 2005        \n        \n\nNils left the house at nine o'clock precisely.

The shock of it propels you into an upright position, like the horrible last second of a nightmare, and you look around the room. Surely you're simply muggy with sleep? Isn't the tail end of a dream wrapped round you still, twirling the sense of the world into a spiral every time you turn your head?

You wasted ten seconds getting tangled up in the door on the way in to my office, another fifteen with a fawning introduction, and now ten by waiting for me to fill an embarrassing silence that you created.

I'm not denying that I decided myself what to do, but sometimes you have no other choice. Sometimes your life is like a chess game, and you can position your pieces here, and here, and strike a blow here; at other times it's more like white-water rafting, stuck in the middle of the rapids, not being able to plan the tactics of your opponent - the river, or God, or the Devil, or Death, or the Fates - several moves ahead.

Plenty of perspiration, though, as he tried not to think about her, and instead wrestled with the workbench and the vice. As he practised the night-class motions, clouds of sawdust drew the bile out of his unrequited agonies, sucking it out like poison from a wound. The rhythm of planing and sanding drew him further and further into a kind of meditation, and at one point he even caught himself singing.\nThe plain, hinged box was almost finished as per the requirements for the next class, and each surface reflected the meticulous, obvious care of the beginner. But the last, the tiniest, the sweetest of his miseries was still with him, and this he sank into the lid of his creation. He scratched a cartoon heart into it, fat and luscious in shape, close in design to the original rectangle. This etching was to guide his trimming, bevelling, and smoothing, on which he duly, slowly, set to work. The sun arced across the sky, and was just saying its goodbyes as he added a layer of paint to the heart. Blending with the grain of the wood it became a deep, dark, cherry-red. He rubbed a mixture of beeswax and sweat into the box, and the romantic in him saw a bead of his love—an unexciting, regular, rather normal love—drop off his brow into this mix.\nThe woodwork class were politely interested in his first foray into design; the object of his desire thought it tawdry, and declared a no-thankyou the day after; he sold it at the market that weekend for nine pounds ninety-nine.\nWhat once took days eventually takes minutes. He foresaw a universe in that ten-pounds-less-a-shaving. One day, he knew, carpentry would come easily to him; rejection might still stick in his throat. Years later, he'd sold ten thousand pretty boxes, and lathed a thousand stained bowl-like objets d'art. But he only had a vague recollection of the woman he once swore he'd adore for a hundred years and more. He wouldn't be able to tell you the scent of her perfume or the colour of her hair; yet, if he only closed his eyes for a second, his nose would twitch on the dampening whiff of the sawdust, and in his mind's eye he would see fields and fields of cherry-red.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/cherry-red.html"},{"title":"At the church","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    25 Jul 2004        \n        \n\nJohn and Bert were only a furlong or two from S. Mary's Church when it started raining. John had kept ahead of Bert all the way there, although Bert had tried a couple of times to talk to his employee. All in vain: John stayed tight-lipped, pissed off.\nThe muggy damp that had held its breath all the way from John's house now sighed all around them. The sigh, made of a fine spray, lay in the air, and came upon them like a friend coming up to lead them by the arm; as if it had been waiting for them. Father MacFie had certainly been waiting, counting the minutes even, and as they rounded a small hill before the church he moved from the protection of the doorway. He erected a black umbrella and his face, like that of John's mum, had the wrath of God upon it. John wondered if the Father's air, strengthened by his holiness, would be enough to turn the rain to steam as it touched, but the reverend had had to blink the cold mist away.\n\"Mr Whittle,\" Father MacFie had begun in soft Edinburgh, \"God bless you now you're here, of course, but you're confoundedly late.\"\n\"Aye, Father. Reet sorry an' all.\" The cap had come off immediately, and water dripped out of it between Bert Whittle's fingers. \"Saw Paulie soon as knew about it, but 'e was buggered if&#x2014sorry, Father, but 'e wouldn't come for love ner money. Then 'ad ter get ter village and get John outer bed.\"\nFather MacFie nodded. \"Yes, I suppose so, Bert. But I can tell you right now that I wouldn't at all be surprised if the diocese wanted to know why we bought that piece of machinery to do our digging, rather than hiring it on a shall we say ad hoc basis when we needed it. We're not a metropolis, after all, and we don't require such tools every day of the week. You will have to tell me again why you were so in favour of us buying it outright, Bert. And remind me off which of your friends we acquired it.\"\nBert looked miserable, but then it was John's turn. \"And you, John Atherton, are late as well. By which I mean you're late for mass. I haven't seen you in church for a good few weeks.\n\"Uh, aye, Father,\" John babbled. \"I've been busy with t'work for Mr Sinclair. 'E's asked me to do extra for t'scholarship, so I spent me weekends doing that. For 'im. Father,\" he finished.\n\"Well, perhaps you ought to consider your priorities, Mr Atherton. Remember that Sunday is our Lord's Day.\"\n\"Aye, Father.\"\n\"A day of rest.\"\n\"Aye, Father.\"\n\"A day where we set aside any earthly worries and contemplate the glory of our Lord, and the mystery of the Trinity.\"\n\"Aye, Father.\"\n\"Well, I'll no doubt be seeing you tomorrow morning, then, will I not? Maybe after the service we can discuss remuneration for the sterling work you will be doing today for God, Mr Whittle, the late Mr Waterworth and myself?\"\nJohn nodded, not sure what else to do. Another flaming hole to be dug, he thought. And another bloody ticking off. Nothing ever changed: day in, day out. Only at the end of this one he'd have no pay, all his work for school on Monday still to do, and the prospect of an early morning tomorrow back at S. Mary's.\n\"Right then, gentlemen,\" Father MacFie continued, now to the both of them. \"You know where the hand tools are. Mr Whittle, you can find the plot again, I take it? Very good. I must go and organise matters in the church, so I will take my leave of you. If you can have the work finished by ten then that would be fine.\" With that, he turned and walked back to the church, and inside.\nBoth feeling guilty, the workmen looked at each other for a moment. Then Bert jerked his head towards the lean-to at the side of the priest's lodgings. You go, the nod said to John. Get tools. To make sure John got the message, Bert turned away and began to roll a fag. John took a deep breath, promised to himself that this was the last time he'd do a favour for the old bugger and the young bugger (God save him) both, and headed towards the shed.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/church.html"},{"title":"credidit","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    21 Sep 2003        \n        \n\nThe telescope had been a present from his parents, twenty years ago. It was almost too good to look at the stars with. The magnification was so high and the picture so rich that the telescope almost gave more information about the atmosphere than about the stars beyond it. They fizzed and twinkled with the wind and air, light being battered this way and that by mile-deep currents far above the young Christopher. Perhaps if they'd lived higher up, or further out of the city.... For six months either side of the present he had been more interested in astronomy than anything else, than breathing or having a wash. Then, with the fickle nature of a pre-teen, he abandoned his life's centre and moved onto something else: Meccano, he thought, or maybe that year it had been fishing, taken up just in time for a glorious July. The telescope, with all of its accoutrements and Chris' stack of astronomical literature and charts, was consigned to a drawer set into a huge, towering wardrobe in the spare room. There it developed a proud, antique coat of dust, wearing its neglect like a Victorian ex-army officer might wear his medals.\nWhen Chris' father died, the son took his chance to clear out his life. He threw away what he could bear to get rid of, and transferred the rest from the back of one wardrobe to the back of another, asserting his ownership and then forgetting about it. \nHe looked at the telescope and memories of his father came flooding back. A childhood holiday. In Italy? he wondered, and then pinned it down to Tuscany. They were driving somewhere near Lucca, or Arezzo, stirring up a streak of dust between two vineyards that drank up the sun. As he stared in his half-doze out of the half-open window of his father's MG, smelling the soil that had drifted into the car, he became hypnotized by the rows and rows of trees going past. The nearest ones flew by, making a swooshing noise as they reflected the din of the engine. The further ones were slower, and at the far end of the field little green dots moved sluggishly, dragged along by their cousins and the laws of perspective. Suddenly, at a certain angle, all of the trees would line up and he could see wide avenues reaching ahead of him. Then the pattern would be fuzzed again, only to reappear shortly afterwards. It was like the planes of a crystal, and every now and again as he turned the field over in his mind like a semi-precious stone he would see a flash of light, bounced between those planes of trees from one side to the other.\nStuck as the Delft building was, in the middle of an intersection, in a modern grid of streets, Chris felt he had finally come to rest at the focal point of one particular crystal, each individual unit a building shining around him. And straight ahead of his window, for a mile or two, ran a wide street so straight he could see the far end. Through his telescope, positioned now by the glass, next to one of the plush chairs, he could see every detail from one pavement to the other. He could see the point where the anonymous financial blocks gave way to the commercial sector. Department store fronts stuck out into the street, and he could see their signs and their styles. And he could easily see at least the pavement outside the restaurant where he had trained his telescope an hour or so ago.\nChris had once said to Jeremy that the view was glorious. A few times he had tried to convince Jeremy to see what it was like, long before the suspicions had begun to ferment and go rank in his mind. But Jeremy was uninterested, or at least unwilling. Without a decent business pretext to summon him up there there was nothing Chris could do. He said to Jeremy, trying to entice him, that he now had a real \"bird's eye view of the city.\"\n\"Pfff!\" Jeremy exhaled smoke, stifling a laugh. \"One day, Chris, look out of your office and then look down at the birds. They're flying about five storeys below you. We gerra bird's eye view. You've gorra God's eye view.\"\nThere. Coming out of the restaurant.\nHe'd checked Jeremy's diary and found veiled references to this meeting, to several meetings previously as well. Then one of Jeremy's co-workers had turned up. Superiority only stretched so far: Chris could get away with having been there, but not with staying there to rifle further through Jeremy's belongings. Then, shortly after the time in the diary he'd seen them go in separately. She was in her white and black dress and something held over her fine brown hair, clattering in her heels from a black cab; he hurrying along shortly afterwards, looking nervous and shifty but that was nothing new. He wanted to see the whole thing pan out, see them head off, perhaps a goodbye kiss that would stick in Chris' throat like a splinter off a chicken bone. Now they were coming out: together.\nThe black and white dress clattered back to a waiting cab, with the crumpled suit following it. He said a few words into the door of the cab, his hair getting wet, and as the driver began to pull away Jeremy looked up, looked guiltily towards the Delft building, raised his head and, through his telescope, Chris could see for the first time that the face had acquired a moustache and glasses since that morning.\nIt wasn't them. Or at least it wasn't him. As he caught a glimpse of that face Chris suddenly realised how much thinner this man was than Jeremy, how he was probably shorter than the woman even accounting for her heels. The moustachioed man had looked straight at Chris,  somehow seeking him out through the mirrored glass of the Delft building, across perhaps half a mile of space. He couldn't have seen him, but for the first time since he'd started reading messages in cigarette smoke he wondered if this wasn't some sort of ironic sign. This was what God's eye view afforded. No distinction, all men equal. Chris could see all but do nothing, figure out nothing; he was impotent, distant and just plain wrong.\nHe got up from his chair by the window and batted the telescope round on its mount. God's eye view, he thought. What a joke. She wasn't having an affair, and certainly not with Jeremy, although God - real God, sat on his cloud laughing his head off - God knows she had a right to. She should probably find someone who didn't spend his time trying to spy on her, photographs and lenses. As Chris resolved to try and be that person, maybe ring her, send her flowers - his telescope continued to spin slowly round in near-perpetual motion. Stupidly its gaze whipped past people on the streets below, people in restaurants. It tracked across people hailing black cabs and people running to meetings. They were meeting friends and spouses, some having affairs, some just having lunch. The telescope saw all this, and thought nothing at all.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/credidit.html"},{"title":"The curious incident of the Dan in the night-time","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    6 Aug 2011        \n        \n\nIt was late spring in 1998. I was renting a college room alongside my friend Dan. Wadham College - my college - has done so much of what they call \"growing organically\" over the years that the room you might end up with during the third year of your degree is both metaphorically and literally something of a lottery.\nWadham's rooms are all odd shapes and sizes, and one localized genre of oddness is exemplified by a small court you can see through the window by the food counter in the King's Arms pub. The north and west sides of the court consist of floor-to-ceiling windows topped by sloping lead, with concrete walkways, leading elsewhere, as basically a flat roof. The east is part of the King's Arms; the south contains both that little window and a room for one of the college fellows. Between this room and the west windows is an entrance into the quad from the much larger lawn area. The concealed nature of the entrance lends a vague air of exclusivity to these five or six rooms.\nDan and I shared the north side of the court's quadrangle: he was luckier in the room ballot, and so got the larger of the two segments. Both our rooms had no access to toilet or shower without going outside, through our doors which led out into the north-west and north-east corners of the quad respectively. Even my room was enormous; and deep, so our rooms shared a long wall running underneath those concrete walkways, through which when we were experiencing typical student angst I would play Radiohead and he would respond with Beethoven, Fleetwood Mac or, for reasons I've never worked out, The Strawbs. But we would largely respect each other's acoustic privacy and the situation worked well.\nThe floor-to-ceiling windows - actually slightly higher than ceiling, as they led up to a kind of Escherish lightwell squeezed in above the height of the walkways - made the rooms far lighter than they deserved to be, given the much taller buildings opposite. The fellow's room had an extra storey above it - consisting of two rooms, one of which was coincidentally my own from my first year - and this ought to have blocked out the light. But instead sunlight blazed through these great, theatrical panes. The only real problem, which was rarely a problem, was that noise could do the same.\nUsually the quad was incredibly quiet: no road noise, nobody passing through, few if any parties. This suited Dan and me just fine. Both of us were hard drinkers at the time, as students tend to be, but we both needed the guarantee of a quiet retreat. But on one night in particular our peace was shattered, our safe haven invaded by noise. It was in the term after some of my major exams, but before some of Dan's; also, it was shortly after the major rowing event of the term. An unholy racket was pouring out of the open sash windows of my quondam accommodation opposite, up above the tutor's room.\nIn principle, you needed college permission to have anything over some number or other of people in your room. But unofficial parties are generally tolerated in the college, as long as they don't go on too late or weren't too loud. This was both. Midnight, 1am, 2am rolled around, and at some point I stumbled out of bed and into the quad in whatever nightwear I had, only to be confronted by Dan doing the same thing.\nWe both exchanged bleary glares, then looked up at the windows, then back at each other. Dan said something dryly condemnatory, and I groaned in response. Either I've forgotten the dialogue, or most of our communication had turned nonverbal by that hour of night, almost to the level of a shared psychic ability. At one stage we both simultaneously had the thought of going to see the porters; but then in the face of the annoyance of getting fully dressed, then trekking through college and back, we both again dismissed the idea.\nI think it was me that had the water balloons, and Dan that had the idea. It could have been the other way round, although as I was part of a silly university society at the time, that did lots of silly things, I can imagine them being in my desk drawer rather than Dan's. Certainly we shared another look, and suddenly felt that the golden yellow light streaming out of the two belligerently wide-open sash windows formed targets too tempting not to try to hit.\nWe filled two balloons in the sink in one of our rooms and came back into the quad. The noise was still going on, utterly oblivious to our scheming below. Each of us hefted his own balloon, testing its weight and imagining it in flight. \"On a count of three?\" said Dan, and I nodded. He counted:\n\"One.\"\n\"Two.\"\n\"Threegh!\"\nTogether, we launched the balloons like shot-putts, each towards a window. Before they had even gone through the sash we were running, back towards our doors in the corners, back into our rooms, to lock up and lights-off and quickly go back to bed. But I could picture, and can still picture, those two projectiles, silhouetted by the rectangles of light they were heading inexorably towards. It's burned onto the screen inside my brain, looking for all the world like a transit of two planets across the face of two square suns, or even the picture on an inspirational poster with text underneath it saying \"Mission accomplished!\"\nFrom inside my room I heard a couple of hoots, a confused shuffling, and then the music was switched off. Later on, there were voices in the quad; but nobody came to our doors. The next day one of our neighbours on the west side of the quad rather pointedly asked me and Dan about whether or not we'd heard anyone in the quad the night before. She was a rower, and a pretty, posh young thing, so it was suddenly clear to us that she'd been at the party, not tucked up in bed. But it didn't take much effort for both of us to reply in an utterly deadpan negative; after all, we hadn't had much sleep.\nI'm not sure why I'm telling this story now. We were both being silly and irresponsible, and I'm not proud of my behaviour itself. But I do feel privileged to have been there, to have seen the story be born. I told Kate about it recently and she laughed at it, and was just as impressed as I was, at a cinematic event that seemed to have happened despite the interference of Dan's and my usual comic ineptness. \nThe story has its own life, sustained by those that experienced it and know what happened; maybe that's why I want to share this little bit of joy that I've only recently rediscovered: because there's suddenly only me left to sustain it. I don't want it to belong to just me any more, so now it belongs to everyone else who reads it.\nSome of those crazy student days, Dan would shuffle over to my room like an itinerant. He'd occasionally find the door unlocked, or one of my windows open enough for him to squeeze through, and he'd break in to mess around with the contents of my desk. He would scribble on erasers, rearrange papers and confuse the hell out of me. Even now, every few weeks, I look for some stationery and pick up an eraser bearing the pencilled words: \"J-P smells of fish.\" I can't bring myself to use it to rub anything out, and instead just put it back in the box.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/curious-incident-dan-night-time.html"},{"title":"Cut off the telephone","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    13 Nov 2009        \n        \n\nWhen someone says they've lost a friend they usually mean they've fallen out with them. The realization finally struck me this weekend that I had lost one in a far more permanent way; that I had also foolishly neglected the friendship for so long (thanks to geography, social scenes and the ever-intervening mess of live's administrative duties) that it was only on losing him that I was jolted into reminiscing about how much had been lost.\nI can still remember the gutwrench I felt when I was told my grandmother had just died, over seven years ago now. It was like a dozen ligatures tearing, like my heart had ripped in two and the halves were falling, falling through me, snapping thin things as they dropped. My reaction a couple of weeks ago when I first found out Dan had died (I write that with a pervading sense of disbelief that it's true) was more emotionally muted: I suppose \"of course\", as he hadn't brought me up for some twenty-five years including my childhood. But the tears shed at his memorial service on Sunday, from people whose sarcastic air of detachment I had spent an undergraduacy contemplating from slightly afar, jolted me into feeling all too much myself.\nThere we all were at the reception after the service, discussing a man who had been two months younger than me, a man whose acquaintance I had almost criminally neglected since he moved to New York. Discussing him a little bit like a celebrity, a little bit like an essay topic, but also as though he was only on the other side of the room, mingling with a different crowd, making his way over and soon to turn up at our table. \nAny time now, he would bring his short, stout body, big, strong guffaws, gleeful smile and crinkled-up eyes over and poke fun at us in his odd mix of Scottish and German accents. If you said something unexpected, he'd cock his head and moue his mouth at you, his blue eyes staring wildly from underneath a tangled bird's nest of hair. He'd do all this, when he finally came over to your table, and he'd be over soon. Any time now, he'd be here: grip your chair, blink your eyes and wish it.\nDan was a charming, clever, eccentric, chaotic, big-hearted man. A joy and only occasionally annoying to have as a neighbour for two years, he would boom Beethoven's 9th through the wall at me and I would respond with Radiohead. He had a sharp wit and tastes somehow both epicurean—fine wines, good beer—and catholic—Patricia the Stripper, for heaven's sake. \nHe was thoughtful and unassuming in his cleverness, the sheer scope of which (he had been published only recently in both Nature and Science) I only really appreciated after hearing colleagues speak at the service. He worried gently and unobtrusively about his friends, keeping parties moving and always ready to share a quiet word if you needed it. Some of his quiet words saved my life once.\nI will miss him immensely and hollowly, like a scooped-out, barren rock sounding in the darkness. He leaves a gap in me, a razed space in my mental landscape, where I had quite forgotten he had happily established a foothold and even set up camp. It was a tenure he'd quit only temporarily, with both of us probably fully expecting he would one day return and put the tent back up. \nBut now I know he won't. Goodbye, Dan.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/cut-telephone.html"},{"title":"That dare not speak","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    11 Aug 2005        \n        \n\n'Illaston 56-8442? Oh, hell-o. Yes, I thought it'd be you. I take it you're after more information about the bard himself? For the great Pally with Pallister, or whatever you're going to call it. Well, if you're sure. I must say I prefer my suggestion.\n'How far had we got? Hmm, yes. Yes. Well, I'm not sure if I'm, you know. One needs to lead up to that sort of thing. It's not every day one discusses something of that, well, over the phone, now, is it? Especially to a, well, you're not a stranger, of course, my dear, but you can see what I mean. So let me start a bit further back. I won't bother you with all that nonsense about Crowstanton. You can get all that from the old almanac; or try writing to that chap that runs the alumni rag. I can't remember what he calls it nowadays; probably \"The Raven's Writing-Desk\" or \"Stone the Crows\" or something equally banal, if I remember him rightly. I can't even remember his name but I remember what he was like. I leave all that for you to uncover, at any rate.\n'Oh, but there's a bit I should mention. Every newcomer to Crower's started as low as one could get on the social pecking order, if you'll pardon the pun. We didn't call them ticks or bugs like most places: that's right, we called them chicks. Has a hint of the salacious about it, doesn't it? It didn't help that these chicks got on in the world of Crower's by fagging. God, what a word for it! Even then it made us giggle. Sometimes we were like toddlers, crazed on jelly and ice-cream, seeing the clown through a blur of that red mist that poorly-diluted orange juice always gives you.\n'Anyway, in your House—which some of the brighter boys would often refer to as a murder of crows, but it would never catch on, yes you'd think so, wouldn't you, what with a young boy's love of the macabre, but not really—the prefects were appointed from the, well, years 12 and 13, is it nowadays? Sixth-formers, at any rate. They were meant to keep order, were effectively as wanton boys are to flies, or bugs, or chicks, and delegated by giving boys different fag duties.\n'See, you'd be made the noticeboard fag, and would have to put up all the announcements from the House tutor or from the headmaster and his office. Or you'd be the staircase fag and have to sweep the staircase. Or the WPB fag and you'd collect the rubbish from all the waste paper bins in the dormitories every Friday. I suppose they thought it was an effective way of sinking all that new-boy energy that would otherwise have clogged up in their systems and made them troublesome. You're not a fan of Lindsay Anderson, I take it? Oh, well, I won't mention that. But it also let them feel vindicated in their misery and homesickness. It was a sort of schoolboy's vision of Colditz or slavedriving or hades or some such, you see. Enforced, menial, rarely hard work. And it probably saved them a pretty packet on wages for cleaners and odd-job men.\n'Me? Well, it was terribly long ago. Not every boy was made a fag, anyway, as there was never enough work to go round, so maybe I was just lucky.... Oh, you heard something from Bassett? What did he tell you. Yes. Yes, I suppose that was right. I ordered and delivered dessert trays for the teachers who sat at the high table in dinner. Pardon? Oh, well, I'm not sure if I can remember that sort of detail. All right, yes, I do. [a sigh] I was the pudding fag.\n'... Thank you for that. No, I hadn't heard that one before. Hilarious. Have you recovered? Good.\n'Well, Hailsham House had one of the best rec' rooms at Crower's. I hear they have a widescreen television and phenomenally expensive music system now, but in my day we were the envy of every other house because we had a billiard table. I know, isn't it? I'm surprised they didn't get the Racing Post delivered too. \n'For the first few days of that term, mind you, we weren't getting anything delivered. We'd heard rumblings—if you can call his adenoidal carping a rumble—from one of the House prefects for a while. Chalfont. Awful chap. Went on to make a name for himself during the war: died valiantly with a bomb in his face before any of his fellow soldiers knew what he was like. Still, he was in charge of us, and though I mock him now at the time I was terrified of him. House prefects had the responsibility of power (well, Chalfont probably thought it was a privilege) that comes with being licensed to mete out corporal punishment. Chalfont always gave it out bare-knuckled.\nSo, yes, bit of a cad, but he took the House rules seriously when it suited him, and he'd been told that the House masters hadn't received their newspapers since the start of the new term. Most of the masters didn't care for their papers, scarcely read them and often (as I say, we were the envied House) dumped them in the rec' room. But a couple of them had lost their temper on the same morning—I think their stocks had taken a drubbing in the city and they'd not heard the warnings in time—and conducted the heat of their ire on to Chalfont, who stoked it until it became an excuse for a beating.\n'You might say he was going to start a fire under the newspaper fag. Suit yourself.\n'The day Chalfont was let off by the masters like a rocket, he found his target almost immediately, Bassett telling him in that whiny voice he had then that the boy responsible was in the rec' room. As Chalfont strode through the house he attracted spectators like a great cloud behind him, all spoiling for the fight as much as him. They all paused in the corridor outside the rec' room. Chalfont swung open the door, which banged on its hinges. He took a step inside and we all squeezed in behind him.\n'In the far corner of a room there was a boy sitting in one of the big, architectured leather armchairs that cluttered up one corner of the room. He was reading a fat volume of Tennyson that one of the well-meaning beaks had left lying around like fertilizer on stony ground. The floor was covered in them: Spenser, Chaucer, Swift; all half-read and kicked around.\n'\"Pallister!\" Chalfont shouted across at the tick. \"What're you playing at, you little oaf?\"\n'Only, he didn't say \"oaf\", if you understand me. Wasn't one for subtlety, Chalfont. But, cool as a cucumber, this little chap Pallister turned half an eye to Chalfont, then looked back at the fat volume of Tennyson he was reading, saying:\n'\"It's not play, Chalfont. This is serious study. You might want to try it. Broadens the mind. I wouldn't say yours is exactly overstretched.\"\n'Well, I... Hm? Oh, I know exactly what you want me to say. Well, for what it's worth, I can honestly say that I didn't think much of Michael Pallister at first sight. I can't stand the bookish sort, even now, and as a boy I was rooting for Chalfont anyway. Chalfont or death, probably at the hands of Chalfont. And we all expected this young prick to... I said \"prig\", my dear man. Are you writing this down? Teatime? Oh, you mean shorthand. This is a dreadful line, you know. Oh, one of those bloody things. I can't say I approve. You're not in a public place, I take it? Oh, God. Well, just try to avoid mentioning my name out loud again.\n'Anyway, yes, we were waiting for Chalfont to give Pallister a pasting. But we'd realised something was up: Pallister wasn't as young as we all expected him to be. He was new and yet old, if you see what I mean. New to this school but at least fourteen. But Chalfont was seeing red now, completely oblivious. Pompous ass that he'd always been, he was just puffing himself up to his full height, ready to stride round the billiard table when Pallister got up and beat him to it.\n'He took five long, lanky steps, jumps almost, stopped an arm's reach away from Chalfont, and before the prefect could respond Pallister punched him so hard on the cheek that he spun round twice as he fell to the floor, landing painfully on a Byron.\n'None of us could quite believe what we'd just seen. I mean, Chalfont wasn't exactly a hero among us, but he was a little like one of the stupid Greek or Norse gods. We all thought him a bit of an idiot but feared him nonetheless. And here was our own personal Thor, sprawled on the floor like a squashed spider. I think it was while we were standing round in shock that Pallister took advantage of the distraction—Chalfont lying with his limbs at all the wrong compass points—and strode quietly back to his chair, sat down, and picked up the book as if nothing had happened.\n'Well, Chalfont was in an absolute bloody fury by now, as you'd imagine. Either that or you thought he was unconscious? Ah, haha, no, not in the slightest. I'm inclined to believe Pallister pulled that punch, or at any rate aimed it carefully, though not so carefully that we noticed. Unconsciousness, you see, would have meant a trip to matron. And thence to the House Master. Even then, Pallister was no fool.\n'Where was I? Oh, yes. So Chalfont reassembled himself and started to barge along past the billiard table, going slower than he might because all his urges were to leap over the table and the baize be damned. He was within about the same distance from Pallister as they were before—spitting distance, you might say—when Pallister tore the volume of Tennyson in half, right down the spine. He flung the two halves either side of Chalfont's head and Chalfont, fearful I expect for his supposed good looks, skidded to a halt, turned tail and bolted out of the door.\n'It was back then, as the book ripped down its middle like the temple curtain, that I fell totally in love with Michael Pallister.\n'No, of course I didn't show it. I didn't utter another word there and then, but I just used the sudden clamour in Michael's favour to sneak away and take a few deep breaths. Good God, my dear. Do you think I'd have been able to fall at his feet in front of the rest of the house? I mean, it was common knowledge that boys got up to all sorts in Crower's. I expect it's the same in all public schools. But everyone knew that wasn't love. Nobody would call it love, still less adoration. If it were love, then you were one of them, and if you were one of them... well, that was risking divine retribution. Or at the very least the contempt and violence of your peers.\n'So I was all very masculine about it. It helped that Michael was more or less in the same year as me, so I didn't have to pretend to be after a prepubescent arse all the time. I could just be his mate, his pal, his chum... well, yes, that does sound a bit.... All those dog food brands, isn't it? I think when people assume bouncy, playful dogs are male, it's more of a comment on the average boy than the average bitch. We all romped in our time, and I suppose that's what Michael and I did: we romped.\n'I was surprised, you see. For someone so self-assured, he gravitated towards me, or at least he was quite happy to let me orbit him, to the almost total exclusion of everyone else. We became the very best of friends, and it was wonderful. Bliss. Arcady. Strawberries and play-fighting and cricket and rugger and bunking off to tickle trout out of the Wakeburn. We were totally inseparable. I didn't even wank him off. He never asked; we were just the absolute, complete and total best of friends. What else does one really need?\n'Couldn't last, of course, I knew that. I mean, I loved him, and I was almost, almost certain that, well, you know. But the school hemmed our actions and our emotions in on all sides, and even as we lounged and chased butterflies it was tightening its grip.\nI'll always remember that day, Michael coming up to me all flustered. He was somehow frightened and irate at the same time. I was so worried. He said, oh, something like, someone had told him something, and we had to discuss it in private right away. It was all a bit sudden, and I started to tremble. Had somebody guessed? Was Michael lost to me now, I wondered. Was that it for even our friendship?\n'Someone had mentioned something, he said, when we were back in my room. But that wasn't what he wanted to tell me about. He shifted in his seat and said, well, there was nothing wrong with what he'd heard, if what he'd heard was right. He said there was no shame in people being what they were and—I couldn't believe my ears, and I'm sure my mouth swung slowly open during this—people should have the right to do what comes naturally. He was white as a sheet and close to tears when he said, quietly, with that sort of calmness that only comes when your nerves are taut as a drum, that he felt for me just as he thought I felt for him, and was I happy with that. Then he fell silent, and just looked at me.\n'I couldn't say anything. I do believe my mouth worked on no words. I chewed on the air, trying to find a sound. All the things I'd wanted to say the year or so before then, and now I couldn't bring any of them to mind. But then it came out. A shout; no, a cry:\n'\"Gay!\" I shouted. \"Poof! Gay! Fucking poof!\"\n'I ran out of my room shouting it. People looked up, wondering what the hell was going on. Barnaby-Hempsall was sweeping up just outside, and I think he was the first to hear. I just kept running, shouting, adding Pallister's name like a magic charm to protect me from who knows what.\n'I ran and ran, and tears began to flow down my cheeks. I didn't know where I was going. Everything was going blurry.... Somehow I got as far as the trees by the bend in the river where we'd gone fishing so many times before, and just sat and hid and, well. Why should I be ashamed about this, of all my actions on that day. I bawled my eyes out, my heart out, my lungs out. \n'I regretted what I'd shouted from the very first syllable, the first letter of that aweful, beautiful word. But, my dear boy, what else was there to do? In a place like that? I could hardly risk anyone finding out how I felt. And I knew that, if I'd ever acknowledged I loved Michael like he loved me, our relationship would be common knowledge pretty soon afterwards. And some secret store of Catholic guilt told me that, without any doubt, if any other soul knew that I loved Michael Pallister as much as I did, even Michael, then the ground would open beneath me and lightning strike me from above. I was scared.\n...\n'What? You think it's what? Different from what...?\n'You heard what? Ha. Of course it's different from what you heard. Of course it doesn't make any bloody sense. I was making it up, you nitwit.\n'... Well, it sounded like a better story when I started letting my fancy run away with me, so I thought you'd appreciate it if I carried on. Oh, don't mention it, dear. Do you honestly think I would have been that scared of what would happen?  Don't answer that, will you, darling?  Remember I fought Rommel, you bloody upstart. No, not personally. Listen.\n'You see, some people think that the great leveller, the skill that public school teaches you, is how to fit in. Maybe it does teach that to most people who go there. All the straight ones, at any rate. But the ones that are different, like Michael and me.... We worked out the most powerful weapon we could ever wield, in Crower's and in the wide world outside its gates, and we've attacked with it ever since:\n'Discretion.\n'The better part of glamour, my dear, and we wrapped it round us like a fur coat. And it kept us as warm as we'd ever be. Warm as two bugs in a—but that's another story entirely. Oh, wait, here he is. [off, loud: MICHAEL, DEAR: IT'S YOUR AMANU-BLOODY-ENSIS.] Well, Mr Amanu-bloody-ensis, it's been wonderful. I hope you think it's been wonderful too. How grand. [muffled, but loud: I'M TELLING HIM ABOUT WHEN YOU PUNCHED CHALFONT INTO NEXT WHITSUN. SSH. SSH, YES, I KNOW. SSH.]\n'Now remember, you owe me a drink for today's fascinating tale. And while you're buying, you can get one for Michael, who'll now be able to tell you which bits were bullshit and which were God's honest truth, if such a creature exists and such a thing is in His glorious possession. Now. Here you go.

Every few minutes the automatic announcements would apologize for the delay, out in the station and echoing across platform, and tracks, and platform.... The excuse had begun as a signal failure. Over time it mutated into vandalism, documented in its evolution by the occasional human announcer admitting sheepishly - but more reassuringly - to a lack of any clue.\nThomas was stuck on a crossword clue. He hated crosswords, but was simultaneously drawn to them. Cryptics just made him laugh with bemusement. As he stretched his legs out under the table he reflected that physical education at a public school had probably made him a masochist, desiring self-improvement at all costs. Now fat and late thirties, he was past resorting to cross-countries in the blattering rain, or lifting weights until his eyes popped out of his jowly head. Instead he pummelled and wrang his brain, like a retching feeling in his head, again and again, pretending to himself that he was sicking up in September rain at the side of the school football pitch. And those pretty legs, every time he half looked up. With those legs as an incentive Miss Schwartze had made him jog and then stagger, and one time even pitch onto his hands, shaking his head like a dog.\n\"I've seen one of those fall over once.\"\nImmersing himself in word games every morning - even if they were just thirty-degree heated birthing pools, guaranteed urine-free - still purified Thomas. It took away the itching in the cracks of his brain, washing it clean and compensating in advance for his day at the office. During the inevitable delays he could shut out the rest of the world and try use the black and white squares to spread out his grey matter and squirt sense into the grooves before performing the complicated sequence of folds that made it all small enough to fit back into his head. It was better than cocaine, which he (almost) knew for a fact Richard was into.\n\"It folded up like a plastic cup, only really, really slowly. A bit like....\"\nMost mornings Thomas had at least the surrounding seats to himself. He gave off misanthropic vibes all the time, although only really wanted solitude before around 10am. Neither he nor any body else travelling to Swindon would benefit from Thomas at close quarters to another human being so soon after breakfast. So he caught an early train, and gave out signals to the relatively few other people in the carriage to keep away, and was in the office long before anybody else, soaking up the silence from the carpets like a hangover sucking at a cup of railway-station coffee.\n\"... Slow plastic.\"\nNo system is perfect, however. Certainly not one that relies on the punctuality of the railways. Every dozen or so journeys he would have to wait for the later train. Even this had been, until recently, a very little burden. From the outset he put himself two notches away from rush hour on the First Great Western timetable, so any problems always left him with a notch in hand. It would still be possible to find a large enough fraction of empty carriage. Indeed, most of the other early birds that Thomas encountered seemed to share his tendencies. In mutual empathy their nebulous, expanded, personal spaces would jostle - action at a distance - until they were comfortably far apart in each carriage. Not - and this is a big not - counting Richard, though: Richard was a talker.\n\"They tied explosives round the base of it, and set 'em off. Bang! it went. Kkkkrrrumphph. Ha! Unreal!\"\nThomas sighed and broke his gaze away from the paper. It followed his concentration and landed on Richard opposite.\n\"Richard, what on earth are you talking about?\"\nHis companion was sprawled over one-and-a-half seats, and was now looking back at Thomas. Like a child with ADHD he kept shifting position, then drumming his fingers on whatever bit of his body or the chair the pose required him to have his hands resting on. Looking left and right for something to interest him, he would eventually resume fidgeting if nothing came along in time.\n\"Cooling towers, Tom,\" he explained, nodding at something out of the window behind Thomas. \"Aren't they great? You should see 'em close up. Fat bastards, they are.\" Thomas leaned forward, and looked round to see the stacks of the power station, squatting near the low horizon like grey-faced workmen, shitting. Thomas had seen them up close and they looked like even bigger workmen, still squatting and straining. \"Thin brick, though. Ha. Collapse like paper, they do. You could poke your finger through them.\" Thomas raised an eyebrow. \"Relatively, like,\" Richard mumbled, and shifted position. He jammed the heel of his right foot between his buttock and the seat, and stretched his left leg over to the seat opposite.\nThomas began thinking out loud: \"They're structurally sound, of course. I think the whole thing is kept in tension, or maybe it's compression. I stood close to one once. The rings of bricks were like hoops, cooled onto barrels to fit tightly. It was like the whole thing was kept tense by forces within it....\" He tailed off, as Richard was clearly getting bored. He'd looped his arms round his right calf to pull it closer towards him, and one eye had started to squint as his mind wandered behind it. \"Like they were about to burst open,\" Thomas concluded, and got the reaction he wanted.\n\"Yeah!\" cried Richard, grinning, and flicked his foot out from under him to join the other one. \"Yeah, Tom, that's it. Like they're about to burst and go bang! Goh, it makes me wish I'd followed me dad and become a roofer, it really does. In the building trade, do a bit of construction, and then do a lot of demolition! Only when they paid me, like.\" He winked at the oncoming joke. \"I wouldn't be that eager.... well, I wouldn't let 'em catch me at it!\"\nThomas smiled dutifully and wished for either Swindon or a quick death. The announcement clacked away outside, regular as clockwork, far more regular than the trains themselves. But there was a buzz, then, a vibration, and Thomas realised that the train engine had just started up again.\n\"Hey, hey, hey, hey,\" said Richard warily. \"Do you think we're about to head off, then? I thought they were going to send another train to come and pick us up. Better not count our chickens, I suppose.\" And to get rid of his eagerness he flung himself into a different shape on the seat, both arms bent at the elbow over the back of the chair, legs crossed slackly, ankle on thigh.\nThomas was still looking at the power station. Something had caught his eye on the towers.\n\"Richard, do you see that?\" he asked, unsure whether his eyes were playing tricks with him. A migraine? He hadn't had one for years. But it looked like the tops of the towers were shimmering. Richard looked round, as if playing the cooling-tower game for the first time that morning and unsure of the rules. He finally found the power station again and then scrunched up his eyes to see what Thomas was on about.\n\"What? What is it?\"\n\"The tops. Where the smoke is coming out.\"\n\"What...? Crikey, yeah. It looks like it's really hot or something. Yeah. I guess those gases must still be pretty hot.\" And he sat down again to wait for something to happen, frowning from side to side.\nIt didn't look just hot to Thomas. The shimmering had become bubbling, had become boiling. It was as though the brick was becoming molten, held in place by perhaps a steel superstructure (did they have a steel superstructure?) Any minute now it was going to start dripping off, like terrible, heavy wax. What had made this happen? What was going on? A terrorist attack, Thomas thought, it had to be. Terrorists had planted some sort of heat bomb in Didcot Power Station and it was about to explode and rain... molten brick on everything. It was a dirty bomb. It was packed with nails, six-inch nails that travelled twenty miles to embed themselves in Shotover Hill. Anthrax. Special, heat-resistant anthrax.... No, it couldn't be terrorists. Thomas kept looking, transfixed with horror. It was like hell was opening up in front of him, the first twitchings that were a prelude to the curtain being pulled aside, the sky torn apart like a sheet, and in would stride-\nThere was a sudden shock through the train. An explosion, Thomas thought. It had to be. The end times. Another shock. Another. They were moving - the wheels had engaged and the connection between each pair of carriages in turn had tightened until the train was once again a flexible rod of metal, a set of hollow chain links with flesh rattling distractedly inside them. And as the train pulled away, the power station moved relative to Thomas, and the rear engine was no longer between him and it. The heat haze rising from the engine's stack interfered with distant clouds now, and far off to one side, away from the mirage caused by the exhaust, the cool stone of the cooling towers was intact and quiescent in the morning sun.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/didcot-parkway.html"},{"title":"Divine inspiration","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    17 May 2004        \n        \n\nTorrenostra is a dismal carbuncle on the smooth face of the Costa del Azahar.

From the main body of Torrenostra a wide multilaner hurtles off at right angles to the coast, like a lightning bolt heading towards the first slopes of the crumpled mountains; gradually it earths itself in fields of succulents, narrowing and slowing, until the tarmac crackles against Torreblanca. Utilitarian and less developed, Torreblanca has more charm in any given brick than its seaside sibling has in its entirety. It is hardly a coincidence that none of my clients would look twice at it.\nPerhaps I am maligning him too much, this gentleman, manager of one of the sea-front properties. Perhaps I am deriding his identical tower blocks more than they deserve. These buildings are hammered into the ground along a fragment of shoreline, the straightness of which makes one marvel at how it could have come into being without man's intervention—that is, marvel for as long as it takes to conclude that Mother Nature has had little to do with Torrenostra. Perhaps I am not qualified to cast the first stone, though. After all, it is not as if he had stooped as low as I: he owned; I merely consulted. At any rate, I was happy to finish my conversation with him and, once his secretary had delivered the bad news about my transport to Valencia, wander briefly around the development. Very briefly.\nThe coastal strip of Torrenostra consists of two or three parallel roads, linked by a baffling one-way system. Right by the ocean are the thrusting benidormitories, but off the promenade a handful of surprisingly nonidentical buildings slouch together: half a dozen houses daubed in the regional, traditional way contrast with the thrusting, dynamic image of the rest of the town; a small church's architecture is an odd mix of mid-American Pentecostal and storehousing; and a patioed restaurant/bar looks for all the world like a miniature White House.\nThis last building is an indescribable mixture of outré nonsense and subservient staff ethic; frankly, it is the last place, in this last place on earth, where I would expect to find God.\nNow. I hope I haven't led you astray with my talk of the church. I worry that you are now assuming that the great, uncatholic Catholic Church, dotted across Spanish soil like an asperges-me sprinkle, has netted me and rendered spotless my ungodly, consultant's soul. The odd mixture of humble toil and wide, Utah expanses exuded by the construction of that holy building has touched my heart, you are thinking. Well, perhaps not exactly that, but you hopefully see my point.\nLet me reassure you: no. Not a bit of it. When I say I found God, do not take that as some Damascene fit. I found him.  Talked to him, I mean. In the bar of that Casa Blanca. When I first clapped eyes on him—Him, I suppose, but let him speak for himself—he was munching on the olive from his twenty-fifth vodka martini.\nHe grinned at me from across the bar, and waved me over. \nI had time to kill. The taxi firm could spare no replacement vehicles for a few hours. I was bound only for an overnight stay anyway, and then an early train to Madrid, so although I would have to book another taxi eventually there was no rush. Still not completely certain he was who I thought he was—it was as yet a gut feeling, something intuited—I strolled over and sat down.\n\"It sure is good to see a friendly face around here,\" he said, rolling his words past the olive stone that he eventually plucked from his mouth.  Like the Ancient of Days he was bearded and dressed in white; unlike any divine vision I have seen before or since his beard was a salt-and-pepper Oliver Sacks, and his raiments were a crumpled Man from Del Monte that accommodated, but did not hide, a middle-aged paunch. He also sounded faintly Bostonian, and was balding. \"Have a drink?\"\nSomething about it all was so...  unshocking (if not unsurprising) that before I knew it I had already ineptly ordered una cerveza pequeña and started thinking about what to say (what could one say?) I let my companion complain about the weather and praise the food.  Before my first sip of beer he had got through three more olives and their accompanying martinis, and started on some tapas that might have been placed on the table when I had been looking elsewhere. Maybe. All this gave me time to think, though, to weigh up eternal verities and prioritize my enquiries. This made it all the more disappointing that my first question was:\n\"What's going on with your accent?\"\nNow, I know it had been tickling my attention since he had first started speaking in that Amerenglish wash, but really, if this actually was the Host of Hosts in front of me then you would think I could have opened more smoothly than that.... But he seemed glad of a conversational start and nodded, as if I had said exactly the right thing.\n\"Like it?\" he asked rhetorically. \"I thought it was quite an Everyman touch, to be honest. Very hard to pin down, and with the right lilt you can sound like you're from anywhere: Australia, eastern Europe, even America.\" He grinned at this non-joke, and then winced at a memory. \"I tried a deep South accent for a while. People's reactions were so darned extreme towards Me talking like that. It was an improvement on my Italian, though. The Pope himself probably wouldn't have been able to have a conversation with me then, though, as it was only really medieval Latin, vulgarized a bit. Well, a bit more.\"\n\"So do people recognise you often?\" I blurted out and, if it brings me forgiveness then I'm sorry. I still like to think that, as my mouth was opening, I was hoping for perhaps a \"why are we here?\" to rumble decisively forth; instead, there I was, talking to him as if he were a pop star. He ruminated for a few seconds and swiped another drink from somewhere, pulling the fat, unstoned fruit off the cocktail stick with his teeth. Twenty-nine.\n\"Sometimes. Not often. I should mention now that you're right, and I Am Who Is. More than that, I Am Who Is eating this excellent olive. Mmm, anyway, it doesn't matter that much if people don't know who I am, although those involved would no doubt think otherwise. I don't come here for adulation, you know, and I cut my cloth to fit the wearer, not the wearer to fit My cloth. Good one, no?\"\nHe grinned. I boggled. An ironic deity.\n\"Don't get me wrong,\" he continued. \"I'm not here as the voice in your ear. I don't want to force anyone's hand. Unless someone wishes advice then I don't offer it: still less fortune-telling. And just because you've seen me here today, don't go expecting the Rapture any time soon. This isn't one of those visits. You're a bright enough guy but I mention that all the same.\"\n\"The Rapture?\" I said, leading finally up to a big question. \"So you're the Christian God, then? Or the Jewish one? Or Muslim?  Hindi?\" Please: like an idiot, I almost prayed, let it be mine. \nBut I had to tail off. He had unleashed His secret weapon on me. It was a fascinating, Cheshire-cat smile, hard to describe but I'll attempt to do so anyway. He fixed me with a stare. Then his eyes twinkled unexpectedly.  The mirth in them swept downwards; in one slow gesture he began smiling just with his two front teeth; as he pulled the corners of his mouth into two dimples the rest followed suit, resulting in a glorious, gently mocking expression as big as, well, everything. It didn't so much convey good humour as an amused, noncommittal shrug.\n\"Play fair,\" He rumbled once the shrug-smile had faded. \"No questions about ontology, eschatology or ecclesia. Or sport. I'm pretty clueless when it comes to sport.\"\nI sighed, and thought. In my mind I struck a line through most of my questions. By the time I had finished all the big ones were deleted, so I decided on a clever-clever one instead.\n\"Why? I mean, why can't you tell me? Surely you can give me a hypothetical situation? I mean, it's not as if you're so convincing that I would necessarily take your word as, uh, as gospel, so-\"\n\"Aren't you convinced?\"\nI squirmed. \"I... Yes, I suppose I am.\" I was by now, but I could not say why.\n\"There you go then. If someone handed you what, as far as you were concerned, was the hallmarked word of Me, there's no telling what you'd do with it.\"\n\"Look, I'd be... well, I'd be all right about it, you know.\"\n\"No, I don't know. I commit myself to a denial of foreknowledge in human affairs. In My infinite wisdom—which I think you frankly underestimate when you meet Me in the guise of a fat-ass, middle-aged tourist—I cause My own self to forget what I know prior to thy deeds and the consequences thereof, that you might have free will. By permitting thee to exercise this freedom I express My boundless love for thee. And apart from that ex cathedra crap, I've told saner people than you, and they were crazier afterwards.\"\nI had a sudden flash of insight and said: \"You planned for that to happen, though, right?\" but not so quick a flash that he hadn't had time to take a refill.\n\"That's not the point. There are rules I have set Myself and these I choose to obey. I therefore limit myself to small changes; tiny, minor changes in the backwaters of human affairs, that I might show my love while still giving you the chance to reciprocate that love.\"\n\"Minor changes like what? Conjuring vodka martinis?\"\nI was beginning to lose my temper. One really oughtn't to lose one's temper with God, although I suppose people do it all the time. Only they're not actually in His presence. Arguably. But—thankfully—he seemed entirely unruffled by my ruffling.\n\"They're tremendously good vodka martinis, you know. Have one.\" And before I could accept, I did: before me, swirling gently in a conical glass as if it had just been mixed, was a cool martini. Such a bizarre, almost inept gesture. If it had been anyone else I would have said they were trying to please, or even atone; it took the heat out of my temper straight away.  I took a sip. Compared to the beer it tasted, I have to say, divine.\n\"Minor changes like having a chat, or just saying hello, or buenas dias, or even bon dia,\" he continued. \"Just because your boffins talk about all this chaos nonsense, it doesn't follow that I don't know what 'minor' means either. And it doesn't follow that I don't know what 'major' means, and avoid it like the plague.\"\n\"Major, like what?\" He began another smile and I quickly followed with: \"Hypothetically. Please.\"\n\"Hypothetically. Hmm.\" He thought for a few seconds, and rubbed his beard. \"Well, not like the plague itself, hypothetically. But were I—hypothetically—to have attempted direction of human affairs in the past, then I would have obviously not permitted myself to know how events would transpire, in advance of those events.\"\n\"Obviously.\" It wasn't that obvious, but I supposed he had his rules.\nHis face darkened a little. \"I had—would have had—some notion of what possibilities I might have brought about. But even My children have some foreknowledge, unless they are truly morons.  Nonetheless, like you're thinking, I have my rules. I have my rules. And if only-\" (he looked at me with suddenly sad eyes) \"-I had followed all of them back then... back in the twenties, then just maybe I wouldn't have convinced him to sell so fast-\"\n\"The crash? The great depression?\"\nHe nodded, and wailed in the voice of Cassandra: \"Mammon! The root of all evil!\" Then, suddenly a little happier again: \"It isn't really, of course. After all, I bankroll this place with my occasional visits—this vodka comes from somewhere, although I guess it needn't—and in turn this bar can afford to give others pleasure by being so ridiculously colonnaded and dressed in tons of marble and other garbage.  But,\" he continued, leaning back in his seat, \"events in entre-deux guerres America-\" (he pronounced it entray-dew gayers, or something similar) \"-were an important lesson that I gave to Myself through My creation; one that, were I to have permitted it, I would have known before it needed to be learnt. Hypothetically, I should add. I've been neglecting to say 'hypothetically.'\"\nMy head swam a little. I was confused, and I felt we were moving away from the point somewhat. I had to steer the conversation clumsily back to what I wanted to hear. \"Look... can't you tell me anything?\" I pleaded.  \"What will become of me? Will I be happy? When and where will I die?\"\nHe bristled. \"I'm not Mystic Meg.\"\n\"I know. But is there really nothing you can tell me?\"\nHe chewed on this, and on his olive stone, and then said quickly: \"where are you heading?\"\nI took this literally; besides, my mouth obeyed Him faster than my brain. \"Valencia, to the Hotel Calidad. Tomorrow I'm taking the first train to Madrid.\"\n\"Oh, Calidad, you say? That sure is a grand little motel. Well, it's getting late now, so I suggest you stay on in Valencia for a second night.\"\n\"There is...\" I felt the weight of destiny upon me: \"some task that I might perform?\"\n\"Yes, My child. In the vicinity of the Hotel Calidad, on the corner opposite, is a restaurant, the Buena Vista. I know the owner well, Guido Cavalcantes. A decent human being, although I will say nought of his religious beliefs, of course. You must speak with Guido.\"\n\"Y-yes?\" I stammered.\n\"Tell him his friend in Torreblanca sent you. He'll give you the best seat in the house, and chances are you won't have to pay. Certainly you won't have to tip.\"\nThere was a pause. Even the Gaggia held its breath.\n\"Is that all?\"\n\"No. I have saved the most important till last. Try the lobster.\"\nFlopping back in my chair, I put my hand to my head. Unheeding, my companion slurped his way through his drink. I was, to be honest, unimpressed. I'd met God, and what was he? A raconteur, a comedian and a restaurant critic. And, frankly, a bit smug. God had turned out to be an American Ned Sherrin.\nHe gave his shrug-smile as I thought this, and my heart fell through the floor. Uh-oh.  Oh, no, I thought. I wished I could follow my heart down there, through a crack in the ground, as he said:\n\"I heard that, you know. Not that I mind. I do understand, really I do.  But look at it My way. Well, as best you can. I can either appear to you all trumpets blazing, surrounded by an angelic host, and dispensing justice and benedictions this way and that, and you'll be overawed and frankly poor company in the cocktail hour-\" (thirty-one) \"-or I can appear as another human being and risk my discourse attracting human flaws.  Speaking of flaws,\" he said, suddenly changing tack, \"you're not happy with your job but you stick with it because you think it's all you're good at.\"\nI was stunned, and my mouth flopped goldfishedly. He had swung brutally round to the point, at any rate. And he was spot on.\n\"It's fairly clear. I have no, well, I suppose you'd call it magic bullet, for what's wrong with you. I think you just need rest and thought.  I may be a healer,\" He acknowledged in a soft voice, \"but there are no quick fixes. Although there may be such a thing as a free lunch, of course. If I've given you dominion over them you might as well try them with that marvellous sauce Guido does.\"\nThen, just as quickly, He was back to discussing Himself, or at least the body and mind He was wearing. \"Consider yourself damn lucky that the presence of Me that you perceive before you is only guilty of the minor fault of smugness—not even a sin, when you come to think of it. If you told a real middle-aged American going to seed that he was actually Yahweh, and he believed you from one side of his soul to the other, then a sense of self-importance is frankly the best reaction you can hope for. Megalomania is more likely.\"\n\"I suppose.\"\n\"Imagine that, My child. A megalomaniac, who also happens to be right. You certainly wouldn't want to be having a drink with me. And besides, it wouldn't be fair on the waiters.\"\nI nodded, still digesting what He'd said. It was a little thing but the source it had come from.... Should I take the time off, I wondered?  Stay the extra day, see the sights in a quieter city than bloody-Madrid-again. Meanwhile, He was still talking.\n\"If the Christians are correct, and note,\" He interjected, \"I say 'if', then you see Me every day. You see Me in the tiniest child and the whiniest idiot. So enough of being judgemental, because there's only one of us at this table that has that remit, OK?\"\nI sighed. \"OK. That's it, then? Chit-chat, gags, career and restaurant advice, and then a mild ticking off?\"\n\"It's a good restaurant, trust Me. Quit complaining.\"\n\"I'm not. Really, I'm not. But... is there really nothing else you can tell me?\" There was a heated conversation going on by the bar at this moment. A customer had just entered, looking scruffy, and began firing rapid romance language at one of the waiters. I wondered if my companion would intervene, if an argument broke out.\n\"What, should I get my crystal ball out?\" By now I noticed He did suddenly have a snifter of brandy, and I wondered if He was going to light a cigar. That, at any rate, would solve a minor ethical matter for me.  But, as it were, no cigar.\n\"No, just... I need something.\"\nHe smiled. I smiled. I realized that neither of us was as angry as I worried we both were, was sure I was. The situation again squeezed out the bad feelings, precluded the tantrums I wanted to throw. And I had no fear of His wrath, although it's hard to say why. Of course, I still didn't want to offend this person, whoever He really was: whatever His ontology, He'd probably say.\n\"I understand. Something to remember Me by. Well, now.\" He closed His eyes and put his drink in front of Him. He waved his hands around it theatrically. Putting one hand over the top of the bowl He puffed smoke under it, waited, and then slid His hand away to reveal cool vapours hovering over golden Spanish brandy. The restaurant seemed to have become slightly louder, and the waiter by the bar was calling something out now.  But my companion was calm, and said portentously: \"I see... indecision. A long journey is ahead of you, many miles and revelations. I also see...  many clamouring for your attention.\"\n\"Señor?\"\nThe waiter had appeared by my shoulder, and coughed. I turned at the noise, half in surprise and half in annoyance. \"Can't this wait?\" I was about to cobble together in Spanish. But he said quickly \"Es taxi para ti, afuera.\" Outside, waiting for me.\nI looked at the waiter, and then back at Him. He gave his shrug-smile, and it was as infuriating, and as beautiful, as it had been all conversation. \"My doing, My child. I sorted it all out few minutes ago.  Time's up. Sorry to break it to you like this, but I'm not so good at good-byes.  I've never really had the chance to practice. Give my best to Guido.\"\nThe next thing I knew I was out in the street again, with a suspiciously spotless cab ticking over by the kerb, its engine running sweet as honey. The full force of the encounter began to strike against me. It was like someone tapping against a gong, each knock less gentle than the last, until it took all my strength to take the few steps to the open door, climb in next to my luggage which had appeared almost as miraculously as the car, and stop my knees from knocking together.\nAs I was in the final throes of the pantomime of shock, the driver turned round and gave me a beatific smile, before ramming the gas pedal down and causing the taxi to launch itself in the direction of the main road. Yes, I reflected: these were driving habits that a thirty-odd martini drinker would approve of.\nI hadn't said goodbye, I don't think, although given whom I'd been talking to then there probably wasn't much point. Part of me, a tiny part, still didn't believe what had just happened, still less in the identity of my companion. He could've been just a charlatan, loaded up with enough charm, personal details, and colour from the Valencian travel guides to woo a hot, befuddled semi-tourist who felt abandoned in a piece of nastiness like Torrenostra.\nHe could have, and I admit that the voice of that sceptic was in me somewhere, but it was cowed by a great calmness that had begun to well up from somewhere deeper down than those doubts.  Far away from intellect and rationalization, the knowledge of who He really was stretched, in His words, from one side of my soul to the other.\nI decided that the very least I could do for Him was to spend another day out here in the east. You can't get a better recommendation for a restaurant than I had been given, I thought. No, wait. I won't do it for Him, I decided. Well, I will, but mostly I'll do it for me. For me. And a moment later I had dozed off on the back seat.\nWhat happened in Madrid the next day I leave to the historians to recount.  Certainly I was glad to still be in Valencia, as the whole world tuned in to watch the events unfold in the capital. I remember waking up at nine—late for me—to hear someone shouting in the street outside, padre, padre! Whether a cry of anguish for a parent they knew had been on one of those trains, or a request for a priest, I couldn't tell.\nI tried to weigh it up in my mind. My life had been saved. I had been held back and kept out of danger. And who had I been saved by? How could I be expected to deal with that knowledge? Would I have to live the rest of my life with the mark of Cain upon me, blessing as much as curse? This might be some signal, that along with my disenchantment with the world of property consultancy, I had some higher calling that would also lead me away from commerce and economics to some sort of purer....\nA few days later I had calmed down, not least because I was back in the cooler climate of London: cooler sun, cooler temperaments, cooler head.  Yes, He'd kept me out of Madrid. But even if I had caught my train that morning, I wouldn't have been anywhere near the explosions. My train would have continued idling an hour out of the city, the handbrake on or whatever train drivers do; I would have been stuck with my fellow passengers, all of us glum at the delay and oblivious to its cause. So my life could hardly have been saved that day. Moreover, He'd said Himself that He stuck to the little changes, dabbling here and there. If anything had been done to me or through me then it couldn't have been important.\nSo what had been the reason? Caprice? Friendship? A deistic whim? Or a subtlety I couldn't see, or that wasn't yet to be seen? Why hadn't he saved someone else? Or all of them? What did it mean?\nEventually I just gave up. It was too big, yet it was possible that it was too small at the same time, and that defeated me completely. But I do spend a lot of my days praying now, although it's not clear whether I'm praying to a grey-haired old man in the sky or a white-suited fiftysomething in a bar in Torrenostra. I didn't used to believe, but I believe now; I believe very strongly indeed. I just don't know what in.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/divine-inspiration.html"},{"title":"At the door","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    18 Jul 2004        \n        \n\nBang, bang, bang! went the Devil in John's wardrobe. It towered over him, ready to topple, and fear crawled over his shoulders as if the tendons were being drawn out through his neck, but now it wasn't fear but confusion, and he woke to the quiet of the terrace, broken every few moments by a reveille on a front door—our front door, he realised, yanking himself out of bed.\nHe drew the curtains. The houses opposite were grey and desaturated. John tried to work out if it was early or just overcast, but there was no clock in his room. All he knew was his own grumpiness and a head full of sleep. He reached for his kex bunched up on the chair. Who was it, thought John? It wasn't right. He'd always moaned that nothing ever happened. Nothing new, at any rate. Fighting like last week, or gossiping like yesterday, but nothing new. So who was at the door?\nThe noise was fit to rouse the whole street. It had woken John's mum, which was bad enough. By the time he had got dressed, she had answered the door. \"John William Atherton, get thisel' down 'ere this minute,\" she shouted from the front door, and pitched the last few words down her son's ear as he clomped into the hall.\n\"I 'eard, I 'eard,\" he whined, pulling a jumper over his shirt. The air from the street smelt of rain. One tangled, jumpered arm banged into a palm-leaf cross on the wall, and Mrs Atherton frowned at him. His head emerged and he said, \"What's goin' on? What time is it?\"\n\"Just gone six,\" she nearly shouted, and as John breathed in to complain some more—it was Saturday, after all—she carried on: \"You've gorra visitor.\"\nShe swung the door wider, and John saw Bert Whittle. He looked bent double as usual, knotted and gnarled like a tree root. Bert's work clothes, which he had on now, were all tatty cuffs and loose seams. Frank, the local wit who loved a few doors down, had Bert Whittle marked as a butt for his jokes, saying once (and then repeating) that Bert was \"as owd as 'is tongue an' a fair bit owder 'an 'is trrousers.\" The cap never escaped a mauling when Bert was nervous, and he was now wringing it wretchedly, blasted by the heat of this woman's temper. \n\"Ay, John,\" Bert Whittle creaked out in greeting as if on cue. He poked his nose closer into the shadows of the house where John was still hiding. \"Needed down church. Grave to be dug. Funeral today, in't it.\" There had been no question there.\nOnly half awake, John cracked. \"Ah, bugger off, Bert,\" he cried, \"what about your bloody digger?\"\nSlowly both men turned their heads to look at John's mum, who was still deciding who would be first to get told off. Then, blood thickest, she turned to the old man and burst out: \"'E's right, Bert Whittle. 'Asn't Father MacFie scowered enough off o't'collectin' plate for that new machine of yowers? We've 'eard enough about it these past few Sundies, 'aven't we? Well,\" she added, sending another look in John's direction, \"some of us 'ave.\" John pretended not to hear. \"You know 'e's not doin' this any more. 'E's got to do 'is schoolin', fat lot o' good it'll do but Mr Sinclair at the grammar says it's for t'best. 'E can't be goin' out playin' in churchyard wi' yew anymower.\"\nBert looked regretful, and spread his arms wide. His cap unravelled into a cap shape. \"Digger's bust, missus. Damp 'as got ter it. I'm 'avin' Paulie tek a look at it later but 'e'll be wantin ter be in ground by then. Not Paulie. Charlie Waterworth from up Rose Croft, God rest 'is soul. Need John to give us an 'and, like. Got sirvice at eleven o'clock and t'hole's 'ardly a scratch yet.\" More twisting of his cap like a dishrag.\nMother looked at John. John looked back, then at Bert. Bert at Mother, Mother at Bert, John at—then his mother leant close and said, \"well, gowon then! Don't just stand there like cheese at fowerpence! Give 'im an 'and.\" John sloped round the jamb of the doorframe, still dozy from bed. As he passed her in the doorway she clipped the back of his head, saying, \"an' you'll be in church tomorrow, an' in confession tonight before'and, my lad.\" \nHe scowled, then moved off before Bert Whittle finished taking his own cringing leave. John's feet slapped on the cobbles as Bert tried bandyleggedly to catch up: John's one-time foreman, boss once more, wishing he had a digger instead.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/door.html"},{"title":"A feast for the Almighty","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    30 Jul 2006        \n        \n\nM— let the file fall—slap—onto the table.

Anyway, the doctor recommended it after Friday's interrogation.\"\nPacified, D— slid the file towards himself across the desk, like it was paper-thin and couldn't be pinched and lifted. With the other hand he flicked over his glasses and put them on. Both hands reached the file as it overlapped the desk edge and began to turn over the sheets from right to left: notes of sessions were filed on top as they were completed. D—'s bottom lip jutted out further and further as he read, and his nostrils flared occasionally as if at a bad smell.\nM—, for his part, registered a different kind of distaste and dismay. He continued with the delicate but petulant air of someone spitting out cat-litter like cherry stones, one lump at a time.\n\"As you can see, sir,\" he clipped, \"we've tried almost all of our techniques on him.

As D— looked up at him for an answer, he just nodded, and his hand clenched briefly on the rest of the wodge of paper he carried before relaxing with a controlled slowness. There was a pause. D— sometimes used pauses to take stock of his visitors, and though everybody in his department knew it there were few who could resist the pull of the long silences. (Look at the file.) He looked up at M—, who had assumed an air of unconcern. No, unconcern wasn't it: it was distance: from the office, from the file, from its contents. D— decided that he'd make sure that M— would get a holiday in the next round of leave-taking, whenever that happened. (Look back at the file; pause, another second or two.)  But for now....\n\"And?\" D— rapped out, his eyes leaping up again.\nM— started a little, stifled the movement. \"And: nothing. A lot of shouting. Quite strained at times. You can see the notes for yourself. Sir.\"\n\"Yes, so I can see. He gets quite repetitive towards the end, I see. That could be some sort of conditioning taking over, of course....

By that point—approximately where he switches from sustained please to Allah to a mixture of that and exhortations that he won't talk—A— was applying a particular treatment of his own devising, whereby-\"\n\"Yes, yes, M—,\" interrupted D—. \"I'm aware of your unease at some of the methods A— seems so fond of. That's why I let him conduct his enquiries, but let you write and file the reports. I trust your judgement in these matters....\"\nHe left the rest of the sentence to the clock. But. But it was necessary. But it was wrong. But they were so close. But the young man could not yet be fully implicated. But they had intelligence. But he apparently did not even know the password. But they had processed him as thoroughly as they dared. But he had raved. But: no answer. But. But.\nBut did he, the detainee, know the secret after all?\n\"M—!\" This time, the junior jumped noticeably, an inch or two. \"I do trust your judgment. But I trust your Turkish even more. You translated all of this, didn't you?\"\n\"Yes, sir, as instructed.\" He was trying to work out where this was leading. \"We've let him speak in whatever language he wanted since day three of the last cycle.\"\n\"He says here-\" D— prodded the page, turning the file a little towards M—: \"-he's promised to be silent.\"\n\"And I ask him, promised who.\"\n\"Whom,\" D— said absent-mindedly. \"But what did he actually say?

As he picked it up he dropped another, but suddenly had the whole bundle under control and was riffling through it, licking his fingers and turning pages the right way round. D— stopped tapping the file and started tapping a pen on the desk, which served to increase the tempo of M—'s rummaging.\n\"He talks about fasting here,\" mused D—, almost to himself, \"before he loses control....\"\nM— found the page, and read out in Turkish:\n\"'I have made a vow of silence.'\"\nD— replied sententiously, completing the couplet, and surprised himself: \"'I am not talking today to anyone.'\"\n\"Later he says: 'I have declared a fast for the Almighty.'\"\n\"'And I will not talk today of mankind,'\" D— finished\nThey looked at each other, and D— began to grin a toothy grin.\n\"The Quran.\" M—, in contrast, was touched. \"It's just the Quran, sir. Two different versions, I think. He's praying.\"\n\"Maybe he is. But I don't think so.\" D— gestured for the notes, which M— handed over. \"Towards the end of the interrogation,\" D— mused, \"what was he saying then? 'I will not talk. I will not talk. I will not talk.' Is that what you'd say, if you were in his situation? Hmm? I hardly think so.  Whatever happened to a simple 'no'? Right, where are the encrypted documents?\" He moved over to his computer and began searching, all the while continuing to talk.\n\"This could be it, M—.... But get the rest of your transcripts. Bring them all up here. I want us to start looking for repetition of religious phrases. I can't believe we haven't thought of this before. Ah, here they are.\" He tapped his mouse to open the files, and looked up.\n\"All the transcripts. From all the detainees.\"\nAs D— returned to the computer M— made to leave. \"The ends do justify the means, then,\" he said, but quietly: he knew from past experience that it now wouldn't be heard. Pausing at the door, he felt that there was more to come from his superior, before he could consider himself dismissed.\nD— was slowly and painfully typing a word of Turkish script into the box on the screen: I will not talk. As he started to hunt for the last few letters, he shouted over to M—: \"This could be the victory we're looking for. We might have saved lives by the time the cleaners come round.

Smoke stratified the air, moving barely. Outside this cone nothing existed except as a suggestion. Four people sat, perhaps. there were the hints of featureless walls. There may have been a door.\n1.\nThe first leaned forward into the light: first his cheeks, then his mean forehead and chin were visible. Each of the spines on his unshaven chin was a \"V\" composed of one grey and one black needle. His skin was almost as colourless as his beard under the glare. One hand skittered up to his face and stroked his bristles as he frowned. \nHe looked at his three companions and adversaries who did not seem to exist, one at a time. Realistically it could not help his decision, as they had no faces visible to be read, poker or otherwise. Still it hardened his resolve into a choice. He indicated this choice by moving rapidly back into obscurity, save his fretting hand which scooped up two chips of identical colour. They were launched haphazardly into a bowl, to lie upon a rainbow of other chips. \"See five, raise five,\" was heard across the table, and the hand disappeared. \n2. \nWith one fluid unaccelerated movement, the second swung himself forward. His eyes were rectangular and slitted, like a pillbox seen edge-on, and looked through glasses that matched their shape, only larger. The two of them looked steadily forward from his flat, expressionless face. \n\"See your ten,\" he clipped. Lips as angular as his eyes cut and chopped the words into shape. Manicured digits appeared and handled a single chip, of a different colour to the two sitting on top of the pile. This chip was apparently worth ten alone, and was almost placed rather than thrown, along with its cousins, in the centre of the table. As the hand receded, this gentleman's head glided back out of sight. \n3. \nThe fat, beery face of a third player appeared. It glistened in the light, showing its curves in a sheen of sweat. Eyebrows and fat moustache were blond or light brown, and his chin had a non-identical twin, bunched up by his collar. He blew out air which confused the smoke. \nCards appeared in one hand, flashing bright red backs as if to attract other cards. Depending on the individual, the combined stereoscopy of the human eyes can stretch to some one hundred and fifty degrees from left to right. True focus can only be obtained within a few degrees of the eyes' axis of vision, but is often not necessary to recognise exaggerated artistic features, such as the scowl of a knave as distinct from the curves of a queen. Suspecting this he bent his cards into an arc that subtended a similar fovea's worth of degrees. \nA second hand reached over to a whisky glass on the table. The whisky glass was present all the time. Like the pot and the table and the stakes, it had its own existence. It was steady even as the liquid inside rocked from side to side: it steadied and the fat man swung around it in space. His fat, hairy fingers clung tightly to it, and his rubbery lips inhaled a short draught of its contents. Blinking, seeing the table for the first time, the face retreated even as the hand flung the cards outwards and slammed the glass down. \"Fold,\" called the retreating lips and they vanished. \n4. \nFrom the direction of where the fourth player might have been sitting there came a high-voiced grunt. It was difficult to tell whether the grunt emanated from features expressing humour, resignation or any other emotion. The grunt itself was bleached as it passed over the lit table. A few fingers slipped over the chips at that side of the table, and disappeared. Half a second later a pale, delicate hand sliced through the light and a chip, worth precisely ten in whatever units they were using and of a similar colour to the second man's most recent bet, appeared by prestidigitation and with a clink in the pot. \n\"See ten,\" said a voice in a similar tone to the earlier grunt, and perhaps the voice came from the final chip, sitting with finality on the top of the pile. It was that little disc of plastic that spoke in a clear voice to two of the three pitch-black edges of the table. \n\"What do you have?\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/four-playing-poker.html"},{"title":"Girls' night out","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    1 Oct 2001        \n        \n\n\"I look like shit.\" \n Angela was staring into the wide dressing-table mirror in Kim's bedroom. Her hair was lank and lay flat on her head. Scattered around her were pots of foundation and moisturiser, and eyeliner and eyeshadow. \n \"Say again, Ang,\" Kim called from the kitchenette in her other room. She walked through into the bedroom, and Angela repeated to her: \"I look like shit.\" Kim's face broke into sympathy. \"Oh, don't say that, Angela. Come on, darling.\" She put her hands on Angela's shoulders, bare apart from dress and bra straps. \n \"It's true, though. I've been sat here an hour putting everything I can find on and it hasn't done any good. I might as well have been beating my face against the mirror.\" \n Kim saw tears prick Angela's eyes, and was immediately worried. Angela was fairly plain - every pretty girl should have a plain friend, and Kim was all too conscious of her \"sweet\" retroussée nose and large, poetic eyes, and hair that behaved - but she always managed to look presentable with a little make-up. Well, a lot of make-up. However, crying just left her blotchy, red-eyed, puffy and tired. And tiresome. \n \"You like fine,\" Kim stressed. \"A bit more here and there and you'll be a real diva. Sex on legs, honestly.\" She leant over Angela's right shoulder and spoke to her reflection. \"Gonna pull tonight, Ang. You're gonna get lucky!\" Angela had begun to smile again, and Kim reached over, picked something out and said, \"I'll finish opening the bottle, then I'll be back to give you a hand.\" \n The club - called \"Scene\" - was slightly too expensive for both girls, but Kim treated it more as a necessity and so didn't notice the cost as much as Angela. Neither girl was successful in their night out, even though they were there until a half hour before closing. At that point, Angela started to feel self-conscious. Only the desperate are still here at chucking-out time, she thought, and Kim was happy to be prised from the clutches of Dean from work anyway. \n All night, Angela had thought she was in a chance twice: the first prospect turned out to be married, although still interested; the second stumbled somewhat when he asked her who her pretty friend was. \n Staggering on their heels, the two girls were supporting each other, heading roughly towards the taxi rank. \n \"God, Ang, did you see Dean?\" asked Kim incredulously. \"Wankered as always. And acting like I should be glad to meet someone from work.\" \n \"That Simon fella wasn't much better. He hadn't even taken his ring off.\" They both laughed, and Kim almost tottered off her heels. \n \"You hungry, Ang? I'm starving. I could just murder a 'bab. Let's get a kebab, Ang.\" \n Angela had a short while to reply, as they were not yet level with the light that spilled from the shop onto the pavement. She didn't know how to put it, but: Kim always ate whatever she wanted and never put on a scrap of weight but Angela was on a perpetual diet and still looked far to fat to even be called curvaceous so as far as she was concerned she could let Kim eat both their kebabs and Kim wouldn't feel guilty and flabby ever because.... \n Bitch. \n But what could she say out loud? And did she not feel like something, something in her stomach that would help just a little? Yes? Fill the flat, cold emptiness chilling her far more than the walk to the taxi? Food? A little? \n \"OK, Kim love, she ventured. Only a few seconds had passed. \"I might just get a sandwich or something, though.\" \n She did order a sandwich, then the gnawed-at rawness came again and she asked for chips too. they ate, perched stupidly on two bar stools in the take-away. Pointedly, they both faced away from the owner. He was handsome enough, but he hadn't shaved and smelled of chip fat. \n \"You need to get yourself a fella, Angela darling.\" Kim was, amazingly, eating the kebab demurely. She used a fork, and each mouthful was a measured mix of meat and scraggy salad. Pointlessly neat. \n \"Not that easy, is it, Kim?\" Angela countered. \"Unless you reckon I should go back and find Simon. Or you could send Dean my way.\" Kim pulled a face and both girls laughed loudly. It was known in the office that there was Something Amiss With Dean. \n \"I wonder,\" Angela said wistfully, \"if I'll ever find a decent bloke. Not Mister Right, just Mister Promising.\" \n Kim shook her head. \"There's not even any a million miles from Mister Promising out there, Ang. You should do what I do: if you want one, find one that's fit enough, then hammer him into shape. Worked with me and Ben.\" \n \"But -\" \n \"Briefly. Briefly worked with me and Ben. God. I wonder where he is now.\" Kim chewed meditatively. \"Still in fucking Brighton, I imagine. Good riddance. Still it worked briefly.\" She winked. \"Got a shag out of it, didn't I?\" \n They laughed, Angela less than Kim, and left. \n Later that night, Angela was lying in bed, unable to sleep with food weighing on her belly and her conscience. She felt greasy and toxic, and wanted to have the nerve to make herself sick. She wrestled with her sheets a few moments and then, on impulse, bounded out of her bed to the window. Slid it open. Fresh air, she thought, and breathed deeply. \n The city was so big. She felt lost and alone in it, never to find anyone meant for her. Not like Kim. If Kim were in the mood, a new date would gravitate towards her. Black magic. \n She inhaled again, and could smell, if not see from her window, the bigness of it all. She'd heard some gink in a lab coat on TV once talk about smells having different \"notes;\" overtones, really. The car fumes and dead Friday night in the air carried with it a note of bigness, of streets and streets. \n One more sniff, and she realised what she was trying to find. Like some stupid after-shave commercial, or a kind of ESP, she wanted to lean out of a balcony, and be able to sense the man for her, somewhere out there. Sickened with herself, she slammed the window shut, and returned to bed.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/girls-night-out.html"},{"title":"A globe of one's own","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    4 Mar 2007        \n        \n\nAt a time when I was arguably quite happily settled and—as my parents would say—in for the night, I decided to go for a wander to try to spot the lunar eclipse. I dressed quickly, stepped out and locked the door behind me. The key-turn echoed in the sleepy close. Everyone else's lights were already off: Witney is a quiet town. I happen to live near the edge of it, though, because it's all edge, and so it didn't take me long to reach to one strip of the cobbled-together ring-road and head towards near-black countryside.\nThe streetlights gave out a malnourishing, yellow glow. It stuck to the mist as it rose reluctantly from the fields and the river, all of these camped out around the village in the valley nearby. There was no chance of seeing the sky clearly through that murk, so I carried on walking. The rain-damp grass had been brylcreemed to a slick finish by the same light, the light I had to escape; the tarmac of the path was the same colour as the grass, to within a fraction of a shade of living, earthy brown. \nI reached the end of the paved road, and turned onto a muddy verge. Its bank led along the side of a narrow country road, both vanishing together in the distance as the unnatural light petered out, moonlight too weak to fill the gap. As I continued my eyes began to adjust, slightly. But eventually the walk became a trudge as dampness crept into my shoes, and the late hour, unsupported by alcohol or coffee, started to weigh heavy on my shoulders.\nFinally I thought, far enough, and turned to look at the moon. Oh.\nThis wasn't some clean astronomical event. The face of the satellite was dirty with a red-black smut, covering all but a thin white chord towards the top, the north. Against the white stars, the wisps of pale-grey clouds, the moon was the chimney-sweep at the wedding. Either that or it had been in some sort of fight, and was now tatty, bloody, grubby and set at a rakish angle to the horizon. Away from the influence of the streetlights, the clarity of the view made nearby constellations look wide-eyed with consternation at this mud-coloured interloper. I put my arm out, blanking out the remaining glow from the town with my forearm and hand, and looked as though just watching was in itself a conversation.\nTen, fifteen minutes passed, and one or two stray cars trolled past me. I hoped that the drivers might follow my example and just look up. Finally, imagining a farewell, I turned my eyes back to the verge in front of me and headed home. Something told me I shouldn't look back up: it was unlucky, or maybe presumptuous, like the moon might now be changing from one set of clothes to the other, and I oughtn't to catch it in empyrean undress. Like all my best friends I'd see it again anyway, some other time.\nOn the way back home I passed by the tennis courts of the sports complex. With my eyes still towards the ground I spotted something by my feet, off-white in the sump-oil grass. I reached down and picked it up: a ball. Tentatively I sniffed at it from a distance, held between finger and thumb. I could only smell new rubber, school sports and wet vegetation. \nIt looked clean, pure and untouched, and was the palest thing I could see away from the stars. Like it had fallen straight out of the sky.\nThinking of what I had seen a few minutes earlier, I gingerly put this tiny globe in my pocket. After all, if night were to pass, and the moon could still not find its other, its virginal fraction, I would love to be the one to oblige.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/globe-ones-own.html"},{"title":"Guilty secret","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    20 Nov 2004        \n        \n\nSquare after milk chocolate square, shiny and oozy from a day's basking in the kitchen, the room with one wall almost all window. She crammed them into her mouth, hot sun trapped in the sugar, the long day's sun that she tried to savour and to swallow all at once, squishing sweet cheap cocoa between her fingers like rich sin, as a car crackled up the gravel drive.\n(Breath mint. Grab your purse and leave, even as the horn pip-pips its summons.)\nBreathless she ploughed her way to the car, house door pulled shut by the air she dragged along. Sweaty she sat on the passenger seat, glancing in the sun-shield mirror for traces of brown lipstick. Sheila said, \"whoof, you're eager!\" and pulled arcingly away, smoothed chippings forward onto the pavement, and was suddenly part of the traffic again. Hatchbacks bustled around them like housewives; a sporty coupé swung in the two-second gap left behind them by a trusting fool, then swung away again as the fancy took it.\n\"Good day, Als?\" Sheila never called her Alison or Ali or, as Posh Pat had once experimented with at school, any variations on Lisa. Always Als, rhyming with pals or kilocals. She'd never done the equivalent with anyone else's name, so Alison had resolved to take it like the endearment it was probably meant to be. Whatever currently might be making her want to ditch Sheila for good, being called Als would always make her forget about it.\n\"Yeah, OK.\" Alison shrugged. \"David Bond is back in the Swindon office, so I was mostly cleaning up his mess. He's only been here a week and he's already tried to sack three people. I can't believe that man.\"\nSheila nodded throughout the above, interjecting \"God!\" wherever she could, but keeping her eyes on the road. She always was the one careful owner, Alison thought. \"I'm so glad I'm out of it,\" Sheila said unnecessarily. \"Print&Run can be pretty bloody awful sometimes, but at least I'm free of Martin Dulwich and David Bond and all their bloody cronies.\"\nIt was Alison's turn to nod. \"I haven't seen you since the last sesh, last week. Been up to anything exciting?\"\n\"Not done too bad,\" Sheila chirped, answering a different question. \"Stuck to what Jennifer told us to do. More or less, anyway. Quite proud of myself!\"\nSheila's pride always had something to bolster it. Alison thought back to when she'd first met Sheila, at a Weight Watchers meeting. Alison was fatter than Sheila; Sheila lost weight quicker; Alison regained her losses later on anyway. Everything Sheila did, she organized and ran it like a military campaign. Nothing half-hearted, but then never swept away by the impulse or the love of it either. Sheila would never lose her heart to Jonathon, or fall head over heels in love for that bloody waiter in Faliraki, but she'd doubtless have worked out how to marry either of them. Both of them, probably.\nIt began to rain, spits and spats on the windows. Suddenly it was clear that there was an outside and an inside, the vehicle a boundary between the two, as early spring pressed on the unseasonal bubbles that motored through it. Tap-tap turned to patter out of the gloom of early evening and Sheila turned the lights and the wipers on in one movement round the wheel.\n\"You done OK, Als?\"\nAlison grunted.\n\"That good, eh?\"\nShe screwed up her mouth to one side, then said: \"I don't think I've got your staying power, Sheila.\"\n\"Aw, don't be daft, Als. Give it time. You'll surprise yourself eventually, I'm sure.\"\nThe indicator went tick-tick deep in the dashboard and, through a gap in the oncoming, Sheila swung the nose of her car into the square in front of the community centre. The building loomed ahead of them, then off to one side as Sheila turned the wheel. Lights glowed in the porch, an awning really, that fronted the length of the centre. Alison saw that the Karate Kidz were being picked up, as Sheila circled the car park, swooping on the space she always took. Identical fourbyfours lay in wait for two tribes of offspring, those changed into dark jeans and winter coats, or those that, shivering, still wore their white pyjamas as they ran through the approaching night into the warmth of their mothers' cars. If the Kidz were there, Alison reasoned, then they'd arrived early. Jennifer would probably want to talk before the rest of the class turned up. What was Alison going to do? Discuss 40% cocoa solids with her over the ubiquitous glasses of fizzy mineral water, while Sheila looked on, saddened and pitying?\nSheila switched off the engine and they both got out, the doors shutting with identical clump!s behind them. Alison realized Sheila was telling a giggly story about her fiancé Derek, and she tried to be giggly but was feeling apprehensive inside. It was clearly a slyly dirty story too, because she stopped telling it as they both pushed gently between straggling Kidz towards the room Jennifer booked each week.\nAlison shuddered when she saw the row of aprons by the door, on temporary hangers Jennifer brought along each week. She had to fight a rising distaste to get into hers, which made it hard to concentrate on Sheila's story, or was it a joke now?\nWine-tasting, Alison had weathered. You learned the vocabulary and how to spot if something reminded you of battery acid or Ribena. Even cheeses she could bluff on, only blue bries and weird Spanish hybrids catching her out. But Sheila's latest craze.... Alison simply wasn't sure why they were bothering. Week after week she failed to tell any difference, was getting nowhere and paying for the privilege. And between lessons she always welched, crushing any nascent taste-buds with economy own-brands. Who would want to train to be a chocolatière, sampling the most expensive products of that versatile bean, when the cheapest stuff you could find, lingering on her tongue even now, tasted so good?\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n              \n                    P.

Small publishers are a funny, superstitious sort. Just normal, human superstitions, really, but amplified by the quandaries they find themselves in. Si flattered himself, though, that his own rituals were like a sailor's. He had the metaphors all set up for any given dinner party—though he himself hadn't given a dinner party for years, because he had worked out early on that you couldn't drink and cook, not to the full enjoyment of both, anyway; one or the other suffered. But: steering the ship of the house, no, better, the ark, through rough waters; telling iceberg autobiographies from the prize white whales (you had to know who your audience was before you used that one); the risk of drowning in submissions... it was all more or less there, and with a little more tidying the monologue would be perfect, Si was sure.\nSo when he threw Hans Myrtle's script down and suddenly saw the sign, Si felt he'd be a fool not to follow it. More than that, he'd be betraying his type, in a way, mocking the massed ranks of his occupational caste. Bad form: ill luck upon ill luck. The manuscript landed on the small patch of space on his desk that was always kept clear for at least one open work. Reading space, he called it, frequently following that with \"tossing space\", and seasoning the whole with a chuckle. Despite the particovered nature of the desk only its dark green leatherette was visible, its seamed buried under a dozen piles of files, books and papers.\nNo one pile was really distict, though, not what you'd call a tower. The sheets of Si's in-tray mingled with those in the slush pile. The slush curled up against MS PENDING. That stack never made any real money; that wasn't where the wage-earners or page-turners were to be found. It was academic stuff, mostly, and it oiled the wheels of the rest of the house, and kept the authors and the bookshops happy, because you had to be seen to be doing something or rumours would start. Anyway, PENDING bent up just as slush bent down; a stack of invoices and bills exchanged leaves with PENDING and slush, and Maggie's most-wanted—she still shared his desk Mondays and Wednesdays, much to his chagrin—was lost in the mess of any number of the above. Five or six other piles had no name: they just sort of leant against each other, like cheeky Dickensian unemployed scamps round a lamp-post.\nStacking and restacking over the months had caused the papers to settle like sand or breakfast cereal in transit. They had all found their own level to some extent, barring the minor disturbances and reshuffling that fell under Si's remit at the house. The top of the desk was stable and flat enough for Si to effectively rest his laziness on; day in, day out. Some submissions moved more slowly through the pile than the seasons themselves. An earthquake would probably cause the whole mess to wobble as one, like a jelly, but surely nothing would shift independently. If anything ever did, Si would notice in a flash.\nIt's not as though Myrtle's submission was heavy or anything. Dense, yes: thick glue made from boiled-down horse-shit, as per bloody usual from Myrtle's stable. But Myrtle's status as a distant acquaintance of Delft's meant that Si would have to send it for peer review—again—and there'd be consternation from said peers—again—and Myrtle would stubbornly refuse to fold in their suggestions, to let them leaven the mix—again. If anything Si was in need of a bit of light relief when he slammed down the two-thousand word opinion piece masquerading as research. Light relief, and an analgesic.\nMaybe it was wishful thinking, then, that caused him to see what he was sure he saw. Because that sheaf, there... he was sure... moved.\nWas that one of Maggie's? Hard to say, and Si was finding it even harder to care. Although it had only shuffled a bit away from its neighbours, in a direction that suggested it wanted to let the pressure off its pages (which yawned a bit more in relief), that motion was enough to render it no longer part of any single herd. Open season, Si thought. The slowest buffalo, he continued tangentially and with dim regard for metaphor. From here he could make out occasional words, but no sense to tie them all together. What the hell, thought Si, could it possibly be?\n\"Nothing ventured,\" he said out loud to the empty office and, feeling a bit of a fool for doing so, reached out for the manuscript in question.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/have-little-faith.html"},{"title":"He went thataway","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    21 Sep 2001        \n        \n\nJon remembered little of that morning's conversation with Dr Harris.

Thankfully, ingrained behaviour had forced him to memorize every last detail of the dossier Harris had presented him with, in the doctor's office.\n The bus and its occupants had soon faded after Jon's internal swoop of emotion and his brief, one-sided conversation with Dr Harris.

One inch of blank paper, like white noise, followed and then the bare panels of the bus showed through. \n Roused by Dr Harris' newspaper (which he wielded like a primary schoolteacher would once have done a ruler) he managed not to miss his stop, and further managed to communicate in polysyllables as far as the office. Idle chit-chat, for Harris' family dimly knew Jon's. The former seemed full of bounce and, when the revolving doors turned off Jon's desire to speak like the handle of a tap, the doctor turned his joviality first on the receptionist, then a colleague and peer, then on the concierge in the lift. \n Dr Harris' office, like much of the building that was not generally seen by visitors, was clad in dark wood panels and, despite its cleanliness, suggested dust. The blinds were, as always, pulled two-thirds down the windows, and a few wall lights projected onto the high, white ceiling. Jon had sat down, while Harris paced and occasionally looked out, down at the traffic they could barely hear. Today, Dr Harris was a gleeful mix of Father Brown and an older Stephen Fry as he padded out the story behind Jon's assignment. \n Jon only remembered the doctor's big gestures, including a brief grab of his own lapels, looking like a waistcoated capitalist. The words did not register. This was fine, as the important details had been tucked into their beds in the file that Dr Harris bade him study. As Harris maintained a twenty-minute silence punctuated by the rattling of his teacup in its saucer, Jon picked up the dossier and poured its contents into his head. The problem. The plan. Our client's courier - followed. Their courier - followed. And again, and again. Sometimes intercepted, sometimes not. Our client gets fed up with his old service and comes to us instead. \n Jon knew, as Dr Harris knew, that he could do much better. No problem. \n The rest of the day was taken up by preparation for the trip. Jon's passport was, as always, in the safe, and Dr Harris had a ticket for him on the plane that evening. Nonetheless, Jon had to go home, if only to pack and shower, wash the malaise out of his pores and scalp. He filled a sports bag with three days' good-weather clothes, and left a note for Alan, fast asleep in the flat above. A taxi arrived on cue at two-thirty. As he neared the underpass to Heathrow, it began to rain. the fine drizzle settled well onto Jon's mood, and, shrugging himself into the seat cushions of the taxi, began to have fun in spite of his headache. \n Ahead of him lay glass edifices and painted girders, the taxi-ing aeroplanes and the short flight to Madrid. The future held his gaze, and his stomach tightened. He needed a coffee, and not to be noticed. He found a cafe, a table; and sat, and waited.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/he-went-thataway.html"},{"title":"Heggers plays pop","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    14 Mar 2005        \n        \n\nI went to see John Hegley\nWith a couple of my mates\nJohn had one of his on stage,\nA sort of Norman Bates\n(Of the type inclined to violence only when directed against black rubber gloves and/or his own head)\nHe read some poems that I knew\nAnd some that I did not\nAnd of the latter ones there were\nQuite a lot\nAfterwards he signed the books\nThat I had brought along\nI should’ve bought some new ones\nI didn’t\nWhich was probably wrong\nBut I’m used to making such social gaffes\nAnd the queues for writer and written were so long\nThat if I’d waited at the till first then I might have missed him second\nJohn Hegley, John Hegley\nOff the walley and off the pegley\nJohn Hegley, John Hegley\nPoking your funley and pulling your legley\nHegley John, Hegley John\nHe was here and now he’s gone\nHegley John, Hegley John\nWith his glasses on\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/heggers-plays-pop.html"},{"title":"Hidden Depths","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    14 Jan 2008        \n        \n\nHe lay in the tent, willing himself to move. In a minute. In another minute. By now, at home, in the warm and the dry, he'd have already been driven from his bed by the radio, if indeed it was as late as he thought it was. Rain pattered intermittently on the canvas, reminding him that, however cold it was in here, it was much worse outside. Grassy footsteps approached his tent, accompanied by the swish-swish of waterproofs. \"Rick,\" called a voice, not too intrusive but with enough power to wake him up, if he wasn't already. \"Ri-ick,\" it repeated with an ironic lilt to it. He heard a third intake of breath and, before his companion could holler again, grated sleepily: \"Yes. I'm awake.\" \"Rick, it's 9.30. Time we were up an' at 'em.\" It didn't feel like 9.30. The grim greyness of the morning was twilight through the tent walls. It felt more like evening: maybe the colour of the way home from early drinking at the Red Lion. That led him on to the thought that the nearest pub was over an hour's walk away, which (despite him having no urge to start drinking) struck him as such a miserable notion that he caught himself rolling over to go back to sleep. Rick mumbled something that sounded sufficiently resigned to his fate; it carried easily over the grass and, from the grunt that returned to him, seemed to satisfy Tony in the next tent along. He tested his muscles against the groundslept aches he felt on every joint that had borne his weight for another minute or two, steeling himself against the damp misery ahead of him. Finally he eased his way out of the sleeping bag, one wriggle at the time. and began the tortuous process of getting dressed, all the time trying not to bump into the sopping flysheet and pour water into his haven from the elements. Clutching a beaker of nasty coffee and some breakfast bar, Rick squinted at the folded and re-folded map, willing his eyes to wake up. The survey was barely half-finished, despite the mass of data they had collected between them. Much of what they had at their fingertips now, neither of them understood. That was fine: to be expected, in fact. Leave that for the ageing computers back in York. It was an article of faith that anything discovered with care and attention would eventually be of some use. The department's systems could churn up the data, strain out the dead mash, and distil something more easily consumed from what was left. For now, they followed the instructions fieldwork had on its wrapper, heading over to the cove yet again, staggering with boxes, assorted probes, and lengths of cable. Millennia of running water had fashioned from the rock a wide parabolic cliff, apparently clad with oversized, weather-worn limestone blocks. Centuries of walkers had made surprisingly little impact on its surface. Yet the slightly more acidic rain of the past few years might be having a much deeper effect. Caves, too deep and too narrow to pothole, might be opening up. A few man-sized lumps of lime had subsided, and one researcher, an archetype with unkempt hair and the electric buzz of the maybe-correct, the untested oracle, had prophesied the collapse of the whole limestone pavement. Unlikely, but possible and so to be tested. The effect it would have on the tourist trade alone won them a sizeable grant. \"I'll go up to the top. You should be able to see me when I round the top of the stairs. Call me when I'm getting close to where we sounded for depth yesterday. OK?\" Rick nodded at Tony, blowing onto his hands. The wind bit at his skin, and the rain's chafing batter chewed over the remains. He felt thoroughly miserable and, as Tony moved towards the stairs heading up the shallow tail of the cove, he wandered towards the middle of the shadow of the huge no-manmade cliff, stretched above him parabolically. Surveying in October had seemed like a good idea back in August. Firstly, it was best to find out as soon as possible if something was going on; secondly, off-season was much more convenient for this scale of investigation (thirdly, on the day of the planning meeting the sun was blazing through the conference room windows). Two men against a party of tourists would never cope, would either waste time in the field chasing the public out of it, or waste time later throwing out bad data, false echoes from kicked stones or stout walking-sticks. One reason not mentioned out loud was that the less the interest, the better: it was exceedingly bad press for anyone to find out that the ground beneath them might, at any moment, plummet through itself some hundreds of feet. Rick wondered how much of a cover-up he was currently taking part in. Why was he here? What had led him, from a degree in engineering and four years' work for two survey companies, to this godawful Yorkshire... sod, perpetually covered in whirling mists and sheep? He walked desultorily a little further then, looking up, realised he was at roughly the midpoint of the cove, some hundreds of yards distant. A thought formed in his head. The thought was childish, but it wouldn't go away. He grinned at its childishness, and stared at the rough stone surface, bending all around him, its focus pretty much entirely occupied by Rick's body. He scanned the lines of the rock: it looked right, but he walked an arbitrary few steps forward. There. He sucked in air and held it. He felt his ribs stretch apart, his lungs expand under the pressure. Then, he breathed in even further, a tiny, desperate gasp, and held it again. And again, still further. His face began to purple and there were dots before his eyes, and just before he felt too dizzy to stand he bellowed every last wisp of his lungs in a primal roar, hurling everything out through his vocal cords and away from him. He felt the guttural vowel bounce and crash its way out of his throat. In that split second, he envisioned himself borne away by the echo of his own voice, coat and hair billowing, eyes blown shut. Visions too touched a deeper part of his mind, worrying him about tiny caves, many tiny caves, shaking and surprised into motion by his voice. And deeper still was the worry that Tony might wonder what the bloody hell he was doing. But he swept all these aside, and, lost in the moment, heard his own voice return to him from all around. A chorus of faint cries all acknowledged that he, the cliff, its caves, its grassy tops and knuckled roots and all the rest of the landscape still existed. Possessed and summoned by his multiple selves, he imagined his bones rattling in their joints, and grinned into an gale that wasn't there, that his shout was too weak to create. As he relaxed his stance, which had become Christlike with unselfconscious melodrama, he ignored the polite cough from his radio, the signal that Tony had indeed heard and was probably wondering what the hell was going on. Rick, though, unembarrassed, looked round at everything as if he had just returned from another world, and thought: maybe there had been a good reason to come here after all.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/hidden-depths-0.html"},{"title":"Higher and higher","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    9 Feb 2004        \n        \n\nThis was the country of dead things, of circles worn thin in the sky by birds of prey, lazing and looping out of genetic habit rather than the prospect of something among the rocks yet to be killed. Were the heartbeats of tiny things still tap-tap-tapping their fear in the grass, they would have been stopped by the swoop of talons and beak. The rock, the steppes and the shelves, all yielded nothing except bits of scrub, roots gently grinding the lichen and the half-food. This was his favourite mountain, and he climbed it whenever he could.\nFar in front of his gaze were the foothills---rippling away, gradually greener---towards the calm of the distant horizon. Though his eyes were steady the undulations seemed to be heading off away from him, like waves. These hills quivered motionlessly; they were petrified by the sight of the jagged mountain, an axe-head stuck in the side of the earth. Trees rooted in the grey rock separated on the hilltops and clumped inbetween, as if the lower landscape were covered with a thick pile of green, stubbly carpet that its maker had not fitted so as to account for the gradient-in-gradient.\nThe wind blew past him. It buffeted against his boots, ran along his trousers and jacket, caressing his torso and shirt before ruffling his hair playfully and moving on towards the cliff face. The air it carried past him was too clean. It was as dead as the rocks around him. Odourless and without body: like distilled water, yes, but with an ionized smell from the thick storms, one of which was congealing towards the north face of the huge crag, clutching its side with clammy fingers. Ozone, oxygen, nitrogen: the minerality of healthy air without the pollution of organic diseases. It took heat from him, but proferred these other things in return.\nTwo hundred yards above him were his supplies, where he had left them. Crampons and a pick, grey metal, a brushed matt surface that matched the buckles on the rucksack that contained them. Recovering them from the ledge where they lay, inert and useless, was a difficulty he no longer turned his thoughts to.\nHis top three shirt buttons were undone. Their loss was a failure in an art, a skill: the teasing of a clasp through a narrow eye into wider space beyond. The securing of his garment to itself with a mechanical trickery, and the failure of it was a microcosm of his much greater problem, which eclipsed also the neglect of his climbing gear. If he could only notice the mess of his shirt, with his head bent forwards, far forwards, too far forwards, then maybe he would have noticed the irony of lost grip, and smiled grimly with the mouth now parted like the door to an empty house. But.\nHis stare, taking in the whole landscape with its fixity, could no longer divert itself towards the particular of buttons and fastenings, but looked out now from the mountain he had embraced like a mother, a lover. Its sides had only moments ago passed him swiftly, like the summary of a life story. The quick, cold rush of wind had not chilled him as much as the sudden stop. The adoration that he had felt for this dead thing had been repayed in its own bleak coin. For this had been his favourite mountain, and he had climbed it whenever he could.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/higher-and-higher.html"},{"title":"Impatient","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    14 Apr 2004        \n        \n\n[A therapist's office. Neat and art deco. Dr Inchwold is sat reading a sheaf of notes. There is a knock at the door.] \"Come in.\" [The door opens, and Mrs Glaiverouter comes in. Mrs Glaiverouter is a humorous Northern caricature, with all the primness, self-righteousness and borderline querulousness that that entails. She probably has hairpins.] \"Ah, Mrs Glaiverouter. Come in, come in. Why don't you have a seat here?\" [indicates enormous leather chair, a parody of typical therapeutic seating.] \"Thank you, Doctor.\" \"Mmm. Mmm. Good. So, what appears to be the problem?\" \"Well, I'm suffering from anxiety attacks. Suffering quite badly, actually. Some days it's terrible bad.\" \"Mmm. Mmm. Let's start with what your GP has passed on to me, hmm? Now you don't seem to be on any medication. He hasn't mentioned anything in your notes.... Hmm?\" \"No, nothing.\" \"... So no contra-indications there... Mmm. Do you drink, particularly?\" \"Not much. I don't like drinking much. Not with suffering from these attacks. I have a glass or two on special occasions, but that's the most I drink, really.\" \"Mmm. You don't take anything else?\" \"Well. Like what?\" \"Oh, recreational drugs, I suppose. Some people use a little marijuana, but don't like to tell me about it. [blank] Dope. [blank] Hashish. Cannabis.\" \"Doctor! I would never touch such things! Smack cocaine and the like! I never heard of such a notion!\" \"That's fine, Mrs Glaiverouter. I do apologize. It's not for me to say either way. I have to tell you that the most unusual people turn out to have used recreational drugs at some point in their life, and it can often lead to psychosocial problems later on.\" \"Oh aye?\" \"Yes, certainly. You must try not to think of moral and legal stigmata in the first instance, once we begin a therapy session together. I have to find out all sorts of-\" \"Well, I don't.\" \"Mmm. Mmm. I understand, Mrs Glaiverouter. Mmm.\" [scratching of pencil] \"How are your familial relationships? Your parents?\" \"They've both died now, doctor.\" \"Mmm. I'm sorry. Mmm. And when they were alive?\" \"... Lovely. They were both very good to me. My father was a queer one, I suppose. But I loved them both.\" \"Queer?\" \"Quiet. Didn't talk to me much. But he never had a harsh word in his head.\" \"So you had a happy childhood?\" \"Mostly, yes.\" \"And you get on well with your spouse? Mr Glaiverouter treats you well?\" \"We're not exactly newlyweds, doctor, but yes, fine. I can't say as we're happy about these attacks, of course, because he worries about them and it affects them as much as me. But we still get on just fine.\" \"Mmm. Stresses at work at all?\" \"Well, I've had to finish my part time work. I were only really doing it for the pin money in the first place. When I started suffering from anxiety attacks it were difficult to carry on, really.\" \"Mmm. Shame. You couldn't have kept working?\" \"No. No, I don't think so. I tried it for a couple of weeks and it were too difficult.\" [more scratching] \"... Mmm. Well, Mrs Glaiverouter, now I have some idea about your background, and you've told me about your drinking and, ah, your drinking. Maybe you could tell me more about the nature of these attacks.\" \"Nature?\" \"What form do these attacks take? What do you feel like?\" \"...\" \"How long do they tend to last? Mmm? Do you find something particular starts them off?\" \"I suffer from them all the time, doctor.\" \"Yes, I understand that, but you're not anxious all the time, are you?\" \"No! Of course not!\" [laughs] \"That would be crazy, wouldn't it, doctor?\" \"Mmm, yes, quite! Although we might be best not using a loaded word like 'crazy', of course. It's important we don't make any kind of judgment at so early a stage in the treatment. So, these attacks?\" \"Yes, doctor?\" \"How frequently do you think you have them? When was the last time you had one?\" \"... I can't remember the last time I had one, doctor.\" \"Mmm. Well, have you had one today?\" \"No.\" \"The last few days? The past week?\" \"No.\" \"So quite infrequent then?\" \"Well, I have the feeling in me all the time. I do suffer, doctor.\" \"Mmm. I'm sure. But we should concentrate on the occurrences of the attacks.\" \"...\" \"Is there anything in particular that sets off these attacks?\" \"Sets them off?\" \"Anything that makes you nervous, at all?\" \"Well, like I keep telling you, doctor, these attacks make me very nervous indeed.\" \"Yes, Mrs Glaiverouter, we've been through this. But it's important to try and trace the source of your problems-\" \"Well, it's these attacks-\" \"Yes, but the source of them is what we're after. I need to establish some sort of cause and effect, you understand. Mmm. Let's try a different tack. How many attacks do you think you've had since you began suffering from them, Mrs Glaiverouter...? A rough figure, Mrs Glaiverouter.... No need for any accuracy here: I just want to get some notion.... Approximately, Mrs Glaiverouter.... Roughly?\" \"Roughly?\"  \"Roughly.\" \"Roughly, then, doctor, roughly... none.\" \"Mmm ah?\" \"That I can remember, at any rate.\" \"I'm... I'm sorry, did you just say none?\" \"Roughly, doctor. I don't have a head for figures, you know. I leave that sort of thing to our Gerald. He did maths in the grammar school, you know.\" \"So you've had no attacks at all?\" \"I do suffer from them all the time.\" \"But no attacks?\" \"Some days I feel like I'm suffering from morning till night.\" \"Not one?\" \"Well... no. Not that I can remember.\" \"Are you seriously telling me, Mrs Glaiverouter, that you've never had a single attack?\" \"... Suffering all the time-\" \"Not one attack? Never? You say you suffer from these attacks but you've never had a single one? Ever?\" \"No.\" \"Right, Mrs Glaiverouter, well, I think it's best if we conclude our therapy here. I will mention to your GP that there seems to be no long-term problems in your case, and suggest perhaps a little bed rest-\" \"But, doctor!\" \"-and if you could mention to Miss Woofrigg on the way out that you will not be needing another appointment-\" [begins to gesture towards door] \"-then that would be-\" \"Doctor, please!

You have just admitted that, as far as you can remember, you have never had a single attack!\" \"Doctor!\" \"Look, please, Mrs Glaiverouter. I think it's best if you see your GP some time next week—I'll ask him to make you an appointment—and if he thinks it necessary he can prescribe a mild-\" \"Doctor!\" \"What?\" \"I feel anxious, doctor.\" \"Oh, come now, Mrs Glaiverouter. I think we've been through this, haven't we? I think it's probably best if you go home now.\" [manhandles towards door] \"You're making me terribly anxious, doctor. I don't feel well. I, oh, I'm all of a flutter. I think I will have to sit down. Oh, lawks.\" [falls back into chair, and fans self] \"... I, uh, oh. Mrs Glaiverouter, you're trembling. Good heavens, your pulse. Oh, goodness gracious me. Mrs Glaiverouter, I'm most terribly sorry. Just relax, there, Mrs Glaiverouter.... You've gone terribly pale. Can I get you anything?\" [breathes heavily] \"A glass of water might help, doctor. It might help.\" \"Yes, of course.\" [into speakerphone] \"Miss Woofrigg, can you bring us some drinking water? I would appreciate it if you could see your way to, ah-\" [door opens. Miss Woofrigg enters with glass of water. Mrs Glaiverouter drinks] \"Thank you, Miss Woofrigg.\" [Miss Woofrigg leaves] \"I really am most awfully sorry, Mrs Glaiverouter. I do believe we've been working at crossed purposes all this time, Mrs Glaiverouter. Now I can see your symptoms at first hand, it's quite clear-\" \"Attacks, doctor. Anxiety attacks.\" \"Yes, yes, you're quite right. Perhaps we can make the best of a bad job, then. I must apologize again if I provoked this attack at all. I hope you don't consider me unprofessional for my outburst. I really must say I regret-\" \"That's, that's fine, doctor-\" \"Good of you to say so. Well, now we have a common idea of the form that an attack takes, then maybe we can discuss them more clearly?\" \"Oh, I see! What I just had: that was what you were referring to? I do apologize, doctor. I must admit you quite confused me back then. I do get easily confused.\" \"Mmm, yes, as do we all, Mrs Glaiverouter. So perhaps we can talk about those sorts of symptoms, and their prior occurrences? Hmm?\" \"Well, if you think it will do some good, doctor.\" \"Mmm, I'm sure of it. So the attack you've just had: can you give me some indication of how often you suffer from those symptoms? How many times do you think you've had an anxiety at- has that sort of thing happened?\" \"... How many times?\" \"Yes, let's say recently. How many of those episodes have you had? No need to be precise. Roughly speaking.\" \"Roughly speaking?\" \"Roughly.\" \"Including just now?\" \"Including, yes, that particular attack.\" \"Roughly?\" \"Mmm.\" [Mrs Glaiverouter looks up, counting.] \"One.\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/impatient.html"},{"title":"Jack's wings","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    9 Jun 2002        \n        \n\nJack decided to grow wings. It was a Sunday afternoon in early April and, as on most Sunday afternoons, he was doing very little. In the park where he lay the butterflies were battling their way round an ascending spiral of air. They fought each other for space to soak up the warm sun in, and as Jack saw them he wanted to fly too.\nMore than anything else at that moment Jack just wanted to move himself closer to the sun that he had longed for these past winter months. He had other reasons for wanting to fly away, lots of them, but he chose this one as his motivation. It was a whim born of sunlight and space. From then on, this would be what he would say if anyone asked him why he wanted wings. \"To be nearer the sun,\" he would say.\nNot that he told anybody, of course: not at first. He couldn't tell his friends. He was scared they would laugh at him. The ones that knew him best might say: \"we don't believe you, Jack. Why do you really want to grow wings? What is in your heart?\" And he couldn't tell anyone he barely knew either. Jack was an amicable chap, and because he saw a potential friend in every stranger he did not want such people to think he was crazy. The smile in their eyes would switch off if they considered Jack to be wrong in the head. Jack would not be able to bear that.\nFor many days Jack strained his muscles against each other until they ached. Over and over he thought to himself: \"I want my wings.\" He concentrated on his back until his shoulder blades itched. But, stretching round to look in the mirror every morning, he saw no change.\nOn his way home one evening Jack was on an empty street, walking past abandoned shops. He looked at the blank, dark socket of a shop window opposite and reckoned it would be just like a mirror, if the light was right.\nAs he was turning this over in his mind, his shoulders began to itch like crazy. Luckily there were no cars on the road, because he sprinted across to the shop that had caught his eye and pulled the back of his shirt up to examine the wings that he was sure were there.\n\"What're you doing?\"\nJack spun round, startled. It was William. William sniffed a lot and stared, rather than looked, at people and things.\n\"Nothing,\" Jack blurted out.\n\"Didn't look like it,\" said William, staring at Jack. Then he sniffed, and shrugged, and started to walk away.\nCatching up with him, Jack began to talk to William. He liked William a lot, although he could be very strange. William's eyes fixed on everything, and he was ungainly and clumsy.\nHe had got sick once, had William, suddenly and seriously, and had gone to hospital for a long time. When he had come out again he wasn't quite the same as he had been. But something in his wide, blue eyes had come out of the hospital more content than it went in. It was like William had been secretly ill for years, and had only realised it recently. Realising it had been more of a relief than recovering from it.\nNow he was less sick, but still not what Jack's mum would call \"one hundred percent.\" Jack did not care. He thought that William was one hundred percent William, and that was what he ought to be as far as Jack could see. But Jack was only fifty percent Jack. Twenty-five percent was in each of the wings that he could not grow.\nThey talked until they reached the end of the street. What they talked about - Jack didn't pay much attention to that. He just wanted to talk. Just as they were coming to a stop at the junction William spoke, as if the idea was just innocently crossing his mind, although there was nothing innocent about it:\n\"I had a friend once who wanted to fly.\"\nJack tried not to let his surprise show. \"What happened?\" he asked as naturally as he could.\nWilliam shook his head. \"He wanted to grow wings, but he wanted to grow roots too. In the end his wings grew out as leaves and branches, and he turned into a willow tree.\" Pausing to look down at his feet, as if they might take root themselves, he continued. \"This was in the hospital. They planted him in the gardens there. He's happy, for a willow.\" William shrugged. \"It's what he wanted to be all along, secretly, and there are more important things than just concentrating on being as happy as possible, aren't there?\"\nJack could only nod in agreement.\n\"Do you want to grow roots, Jack?\" William asked plainly, and sniffed.\n\"No,\" answered Jack. \"I have roots. I am fed up with my roots and want to get rid of them.\" Jack clumsily lifted up each foot in turn, to show William they were only temporarily stuck to the ground.\nWilliam grinned. \"You'll do all right, Jack,\" he said. \"You'll be happy, for a whatever-you-are.\" Then, with a sniff, he turned away from Jack and walked in the opposite direction from Jack's home. He scuffed his feet, Jack noticed - keeping them as close to the ground as he could.\nThat night Jack spent a whole hour peering into the mirror. There was no doubt: the bottom points of his shoulders were that bit sharper. Most would not notice, but Jack had studied his back so much these past few weeks that he was sure of it.\nNow that his wings had started to grow Jack doubled his concentration on them. He was also more sure than ever that he wanted them, and so felt brave enough to tell a few of his friends about them. Mostly they just smiled politely and waited for the punchline, or thought it was just something you said to fill a pause in the conversation. They didn't take it literally.\nExcept Rebecca, who said she didn't believe that he was growing wings. \"I want to see them,\" she said. Jack was a bit frightened of Rebecca, but he liked her as well, very much. So he lifted his T-shirt to show her the wing buds that were now quite obvious on his back.\nBut Rebecca hardly glanced at them, and instead waved him away, laughing. \"I can't see any wings, Jack!\" she cried. \"You're so funny sometimes!\" And she wrinkled her nose in a way that made Jack's nose fall - splash - through his stomach and the floor. Only this time when that happened it just made him wish for his wings all the more, and his whole back itched.\nIn a few days Jack began to develop a hump on his back, and he was glad for a sudden cold spell that allowed him to wear a baggy jacket to hide his wings.\nUnderneath hard, calloused skin he could feel new bones knitting and moving, and nerves threading through membranes, and muscles that stretched and spasmed as if somebody else was causing them to move. It hurt terribly, and Jack did not get much sleep. Sometimes he had an urge to stretch and yawn, and when he did so there were twitches in his back he didn't recognise. It made him excited and queasy at the same time.\nHe cut a hole in the back of his jacket, which was now beginning to tighten over his hump. Then he removed a panel of toughened cloth from his rucksack and fitted it over the hole, taping and stapling it in place. There was a feeling inside him, as if he was going to give birth, or be terribly ill with the flu, and he just knew in his heart that he would have wings soon. \nHe decided to play truant for a few days to see what happened. During the day he sat and sweated in the sun by the river and the duck pond. At night he snuck in late enough that he wasn't noticed. He would take off his jacket, and his rucksack, and a huge baggy T-shirt that stopped the jacket lining from making him sore. Then Jack would flex and bend like a body-builder testing his strength.\nIt was on the third day that he was truant, that Jack's feeling of expectation suddenly exploded like a flare inside him. He was lying on Port Meadow, and the sun was high in the sky, and it bounced off the grass and the buildings in the distance. Jack was warmed to the core. Without thinking about what he was doing he removed his disguise down to his red T-shirt. In the middle of the field he stood up and cried out, stretching every tendon he had as tight as he possibly could.\nWith the crackle of old newspapers the dead skin on Jack's back was sloughed aside. The suddenness of it made Jack cry out, and his T-shirt tore up the back to reveal new, pink skin and two heavy, feathery wings. Grunting, Jack shifted them open. They spread reluctantly. They were a little sticky. He stood in the sun for a few minutes to let them dry.\nA few hundred yards off, an elderly couple walking their dog were the only people who saw Jack open his wings for the first time. They were sure that he hadn't just grown wings. The old man thought that Jack might be struggling with a kite, whereas his wife saw someone airing a cream-white blanket in the wind before putting it down to lie on. The dog, in the stupid way that dogs have, was amazed at how much, even at this distance, Jack looked like a beautiful angel.\nJack was resolved now. He bounced a few dozen strides across the grass. The wind tugged at his back. He ran towards the river bank and started downhill, approaching the water. Then he pulled his wings in and suddenly he was airborne - just. He cut a spiral in the sky, getting higher and higher.\nVery quickly he was many miles up and heading away from what was once his home. All around him the sky was blue, as blue as William's eyes. It occurred to him that he hadn't looked back yet. \"Do I want to?\" he thought, then carried on heading towards the sun. Jack wondered about Icarus, but Icarus had been a faker. Jack's wings were made of himself. And he knew, as the sun got bigger, that he wasn't so stupid that he wouldn't turn away if he started getting too hot.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/jacks-wings.html"},{"title":"A labour of love","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    9 Aug 2004        \n        \n\nEdward climbed up the last set of stairs. His right kneecap crackled when he flexed the joint under it, and he was breathing heavily. Under his moustache and around his hatband he sweated invisibly. At last he reached the fourth floor landing. He bade his heart slow down, and noticed that his surroundings had, between there and the floor below, become much more ornate: opulent in a faded, wistful way. The colour of the wallpaper was dark, and that of the wood darker. All was illuminated by a solitary, dim lightbulb, hung inside the trappings of what was once a gas mantle. Perhaps this part of the house had been fitted out in some earlier period of affluence, during which the then owner had not cared to make repairs to the rest of it; thus, unprotected, the lower floors had suffered more than this one since.\nThere were only two doors on the landing. Edward envisioned them leading to tiny dormer rooms, squeezed into the attic space and criss-crossed with beams. He padded as quietly as he could between them to ascertain which one might reveal the object of his quest. One was unmarked and looked long unused: dust on the doorhandle and a plain storecupboard keyhole. The other was more in keeping with the once-proud décor, with brass fittings and a name tag that read:\nMr MARTIN JONATHAN ERIN\nHaving read this, Edward knocked on the door; too quietly, he felt, and he was about to repeat the manœuvre with more authority when the door was blown inwards as if by a gust of wind. Standing in the opening was a tall, thin gentleman in a suit that seemed to be made entirely of pieces of drainpipe. His head was round and almost bald, with tufts of dark hair over the prominent ears and peeping out from his beak of a nose. His eyes were large, bright blue, and seemed none too pleased at the vision of Edward outside his lodgings. \n\"Mr Erin?\" Edward enquired as politely as the heaves of his chest permitted. Suddenly remembering, he swiped off his hat and held it between his hands.\nThe figure nodded once, and the gesture carried weight as if it were made from lead and granite. Then Edward's host strode away from the door. Uncertainly, embarrassedly, Edward crossed the threshold and followed him. \nOnce inside, Edward was certain that the room could hardly have been described as a poky garret. It was instead a glorious penthouse suite, spacious and light. A billiards-green carpet stretched away into the distance, with furniture dotted about as if on a great lawn and spots made golden with sunlight to complete the illusion. A round table, six foot across, was baized with material of the same colour as the carpet, and a few leather chairs were arranged round it. Mr Erin cut across the room to one of those chairs. He sat down suddenly but with restraint, like the blow of a hammer. Next to his seat was a large album, stuffed with postcards of different colours, their dog-ears poking out from the pages. As Edward walked nervously over to join Mr Erin he looked across at high windows leading out onto a patio, and mirrors on the walls enlarging the room to a fearful infinitude. In the distance were three of doors leading, Edward presumed, to Mr Erin's personal rooms: his toilet, perhaps, and his bedroom and kitchen. He sat down opposite the thin man and waited.\nEvery two seconds a clock ticked, pausing in between like a sickly heart. It must, Edward thought, rest on a mantlepiece so far in the distance that had not even noticed it. There was the distant sound of the cabs and crowds in the street—more muffled even than out on the stairs—the squeak of Mr Erin's shiftings on the leather chair, and Edward's own breathing, now settling. No other noise could be heard, and the moments fell into the silence like drips from a tap.\nSuddenly Edward spoke. \"Mr Erin,\" he started, and coughed, and said it again: \"Mr Erin, I hope you received my letter of introduction from Markus Dowager.\" (In one sharp movement Mr Erin picked it up from behind the album, and in another he thrust it back onto the baize.) \"He came to me after having received your, uh, manuscript last week. He seemed quite excited, in fact, although in the normal course of events I would prefer not to call Mr Dowager an excitable chap, if you understand me correctly.\"\nImpassively Mr Erin sat straight in his chair, regarding Edward lazily, almost contemptibly. This stare forced Edward to continue.\n\"In fact, I do believe that your work had a profound and not altogether healthy effect on Mr Dowager's mental constitution. I would state further that such an effect was the intention of your work. Would that be correct, Mr Erin?\" \nMr Erin smiled a little, and it brought a sharp glint to his eyes. From his seat Edward could just make out words on the cards, but could not leaven the distant letters with any kind of sense. The smile was not encouraging, but Edward felt that he ought to at least smile back—a joke shared between gentlemen—and made a weak attempt. It gave him time to collect his thoughts and deliver his speech.\n\"Given the nature of the, uh, effect which your book appears capable of working upon the character of such a man as Mr Dowager, I have come here today, uh, Mr Erin, to offer to promote your book to such a publisher as will be willing to print it for you. I will negotiate competitive royalties for you as the author of this work, and will extract only a modest percentage for myself. With your permission I would like to start immediately on securing rights, engaging typesetters and developing a scheme whereby as widespread a distribution of your book as is possible can be begun.\"\nEdward stopped, triumphant. Mr Erin opened the album, watching the interloper until the last possible second. Then he ran his eyes over the first few pages, and picked out a card which was left loosely in between two of them. It was yellow: in the system of Mr Erin's own devising the colour yellow indicated a query. He held it up towards Edward, who read:\nWHY?\nIt made Edward blink. How unusual! he thought. An author wanting Edward to justify interest in his work? What an easy question to answer! \"Oh, Mr Erin!\" he cried.  \"Why? Because it will make money!\" he declared gleefully. \"What other reason do I require as a literary agent? Mr Dowager tells me that, although Prebin and Pevsner tried their damnedest (pardon my language, sir) to stifle any external reference to the matter, your manuscript drove two of their editors out of their jobs, and one of them is now drinking himself into an early grave. I cannot speculate on why it had such an effect on them, but imagine the interest that might be generated among the public if we reveal, indirectly perhaps, that your book may be dangerous! They would hesitate once, then snatch such a book from our hands as if their lives depended on it. In a world where nothing may be taken for granted, yet I still hope that the success of your book is guaranteed.\"\nEdward was now in his element, painting a picture of the book both in his mind and, by a cunning projection which his salesmanship enabled him to practice, in the minds of all the customers he could see queuing for it at bookshops across the country, if not the world.\n\"You may have complete faith in my labours, Mr Erin. I foresee very few difficulties in publishing your work, despite its content: in fact, because of it! I hasten to add that I have not read the book myself. Markus advised against it, and from his vague and frankly delirious descriptions of its contents I do not wish to rest my eyes upon its pages. \n\"But suffice it to say that, as a man of commerce, with knowledge of the market and of Mr Dowager's opinion of the book, there is no need for me to actually read the work before presenting it to the man in the street for his immediate, greedy acquisition. I have, it is true, published many authors' books without having read a single line of print. Such a chore would greatly decrease my enjoyment of the whole enterprise, for I would scarcely consider myself a literary gentleman. If anything a lack of direct knowledge of what is in a book often helps the process of selling it—\" \nSuddenly, Mr Erin held up another card:\nWHOSE?\nWhose? Whose books, perhaps, Edward wondered? \"I hope you do not mind my presumtion, Mr Erin, in answering the question I believe you to have posed. I have handled a number of clients of both the highest and lowest public esteem, both of these extremeties requiring tremendous discretion. The names of many of these I could not permit myself to speak of, even if I wished to do so: I hope you understand. \n\"Yet it may impress you to hear that the imminent arrival on the literary scene of the autobiography of a certain Alfred Douglas was in no small part down to my diligent negotiations with a number of publishers. They each eventually agreed to take only the rights in countries in which they felt they had little audience for their existing titles. Hence they would have no popularity to lose should the venture fire a shot back in their faces. I have no doubt that, with careful choice of publisher, we will see your book published in what might be considered no time at all. Indeed, I already have such a publishing house in mind!\"\nWHICH?\nAlready Edward had been thoroughly disconcerted by Mr Erin's forthrightness: outright rudeness he might have called it, were Mr Erin not such a poor, pitiable victim of misfortune. The suddenness of each question's appearance made it difficult for Edward to collect his thoughts and answer promptly. Yet he paused to do so, and continued.\n\"Well, Mr Erin, I cannot imagine Prebin and Pevsner publishing this work under any circumstances. After hearing of the distress that its contents appear to have caused their staff, Lord Prebin himself burned the copy you sent them, I believe. However, I have been able to apply a certain duress on an employee at — & co, a respectable publishing firm, without a doubt. My bond is sufficient with this gentleman that he in turn will convince his employers to request the worldwide copyrights from you, as soon as I report your decision to their secretaries.\"\nEdward shifted in his chair. Mr Erin did not move, but gazed levelly back. With cold, malevolent eyes he took in the whole of Edward, preyed upon him, sizing him up as if for eventual consumption. Edward looked down, losing a small battle by this involuntary action.\n\"I must warn you, though, Mr Erin,\" he mumbled, hoping that those saucer ears might not hear. \"There may be one area of difficulty in this project that I am proposing.\"\nMr Erin's eyebrows raised, and his mouth tensed into a line. He shuffled through the small deck on the table, then thrust a card at Edward:\nWHAT?\nEdward sighed. It would have to be spoken of sooner or later, and perhaps this way he might enter into a contract of greater solidity with Mr Erin. Better, too, that he deliver the news as downcast as he dared, so that the deliverance that he had already planned and set in motion might seem all the more impressive.\n\"The censors, Mr Erin. They will hear of your book and may attempt to have it banned before even the advanced publicity appears in the newspapers.\" He looked down at his hands again for a moment. \"Nonetheless, it may be that we might in a sense avoid the circuitous route which approval must normally take, and quickly secure the permission at least to publish immediately, and this would propel us forwards until the hullaballoo (which I have no doubt will follow the first sales of your book) forces the authorities to take further action against you.\"\nHOW?\n\"As with my debtor in — & co, there exist men in the censors' office whom I have to some extent tamed, over the years, by means of reciprocal favours. Some of them served with me in the last war. While I cannot guarantee the long-term safety of your book from the tearing, senseless hands of the censors—not in the United Kingdom, at least—I can nonetheless see that its copies reach the shelves, and leap from them, before Lady Justice grinds round to your spot on the great wheel. In the interim, with a botched-together approval from their department, your work will enter the marketplace unhindered. And the publicity will guarantee sales from abroad, such as they can be managed, for years to come.\"\nEdward was about to continue to speak, but then thought better of it and closed his mouth. Mr Erin saw Edward's confusion, but did nothing. To bridge the silence would have been difficult, so dependent was Mr Erin on his reams of coloured cards. By such time as Mr Erin might finish piecing together a consolation, Edward might want to speak again. And, besides, Mr Erin felt a cool loathing for Edward. It was but a splinter of the great beam of misanthropy that Mr Erin had carried across his shoulders all his life, an upwelling of poisonous spite in his bosom that he dammed and reserved for his own purposes, in the absence of anything else upon which to dote. If Edward were having difficult with words, then let him. While his guest struggled, Mr Erin cast his inward eye across those phonemes and lexemes of which he had been bereft all his life. As a baby he had never cried. So let his garrulous guest stumble over something so minuscule and so enormous as a sentence!\nEdward ceased faltering abruptly, and burst out, turning red with embarrassment: \"Mr Erin. I would not refer to the matter were it not for the peculiar content of the book. Will you... that is to say, do you wish to publish this work under a pseudonym?\"\nMr Erin leapt for a card of a similar hue to Edward's blushes: a decision. \nNO.\n\"You surprise me a little, Mr Erin. You are aware of the negative publicity that will be generated by this work in certain quarters, notwithstanding its undoubtable success in others? Some will doubtless find your work repellent: artistically, morally, in content or form. We will of course attempt to manipulate such apparently adverse publicity, but... would you not prefer some distance between yourself and the hoi polloi that would doubtless react aversely to the fruit of your intellectual loins?\"\nNO.\nEdward sighed. \"Very well, sir. Well, with your agreement, I will begin negotiations immediately, and see to it that you are published as soon as is humanly possible.\"\nWHEN?\n\"If you're willing to let us use the uncorrected proofs—I would suggest that this is the wisest course of action, given what Mr Dowager feels is the nature of your work—then we can probably begin communicating with the typesetters within the next few days.\"\nWHO?\n\"Well... I feel it would be better for us to employ a couple of firms working on alternate pages; Mr Dowager has, without really realizing it, I fear, assured me that such a ruse should avoid either gentleman from becoming—shall we say?—overexcited by the book. The typographical eccentricities demonstrated by a number of authors recently have established a precedent for almost any curiosity we dare to visit upon the setters. We can tell each body of men that the book is intended to have only odd or even pages, and I dare say they will believe it with not a raised eyebrow between them.\"\nWHERE?\n\"Do you know, Mr Erin, that's a very good point!\" Edward became animated, as if Mr Erin's monosyllabic communications comprised genuine interest in the plan he had brought before him. \"I had not considered the location of the companies, but I suggest our plan might be made optimal by placing one half of the book with a company here in the city, and perhaps the other with one of the great printers in Germany or Italy. I know a team at Mannheutium-Verlag that will be the very model of discretion. I will contact them directly.\n\"So, Mr Erin. Do I have your consent to act as your agent in this matter?\"\nEdward waited. As he cleared his throat, to repeat the question, Mr Erin suddenly breathed in through the caverns of his nose. From the table in front of him there was a flash of brick-red.\nYES.\nRelief flooded through Edward's body, not least because the interview had been successful. Despite the great space in the room he had begun to feel as if he were in the smallest of cupboards, cramped by brooms, buckets and other household implements into an uncomfortable and unsustainable position. He passed over a contract which was autographed rather than signed before being returned to him. At this point Edward rose from the chair with a longing to stretch his legs, and formulated such farewells as were appropriate for his new client, the terrible, mute Mr Erin.\nBut his host raised a hand, and half-pointed his forefinger at the ceiling. Attend, the gesture said to Edward. For his part Edward was fearful of  jeopardizing the agreement, even now. Though the contract was signed it was for complicated legal reasons not entirely binding. There was still the possibility of failure for Edward. He therefore paused, as respectfully as he could, in his leave-taking.\nThough standing right before him, Edward receded in Mr Erin's great, feverish brain. Still seated, this freakish figure took up the album, laid it in his lap, and began turning its pages. The cards he used most were loose, and slid towards the spine as he leafed through; the rare words were held in place by the cutouts intended for photographs. Rarer still were the later words, those least visited by Mr Erin's questing, pinching fingers.\nHe read each word quickly, piling them on top of each other in his mind. They compressed under the weight of their own meaning into a dense mass of nonsensical sense. These powerful words that others flung around like juvenile kisses: he of all people had collected all of them together and distilled their mortifying knowledge into his opus. Only he understood the power of what he could not himself possess. And now he would have his revenge, he knew, on the noise and the mockery that had taunted him and eluded him since he first saw the dirty light of the world. He would wrap this verbiage around in itself and squeeze it into a rock so hard that it would dash out the brains of all who charged against it....\nAs he came to the end of the book, Mr Erin saw that one card had been hidden behind another, pinned together by the corners on the very back page, the least visited page, of his album. A phrase doubly, triply rare, then! He pulled away the card in front and read what had been uncovered on its blue background: blue, he remembered, meant an interjection. Mr Erin could not remember when last he used this phrase, but suddenly it had acquired some meagre relevance in his woeful life; even in the presence of this man who disgusted him. And so, smiling grimly, he plucked the card from its mount and held it up for Edward to see.\nTHANK YOU.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/labour-love.html"},{"title":"A little bit of espionage","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    23 Sep 2001        \n        \n\nI don't know how much of this is clever, how much is clever-clever, or how much is obvious or complete rubbish. But it all struck me as interesting, so I reproduce it here. I'm only really still at the stage of discovering how these strange things called \"stories\" actually work, so I crave the indulgence of the more cogent critic.\n Chapters\nIf you haven't read the story itself yet, you might want to do so. It's only five chapters and it's faultless and beautiful, you bloody philistines. It starts here.\nExplanation\nAfter the minor failure of my six-part story to really carry as far as the end, I decided to write a new story. Or rather, it decided to write itself: the first two chapters were written largely independently, and then it was clear that a bigger story could be told using them and other short stories. I think this story is a lot stronger, as no one chapter is written as filler in order to carry the others. Thus they can be read as individual short stories, or as a five-part work.\nSome judicious editing and re-editing allowed this to be taken even further. Not only are the five stories largely capable of being taken out of context, but they can be put together in several different contexts. I'm no Scott McCloud (thankfully) but I thought this was interesting enough for a bit of discussion. To do so, we'll need one or two diagrams. Because I've always been a fan of the style of the London Underground map's design, I've shamelessly and ineptly copied it. I don't know how much I've unintentionally intentionally forced it, but there is also a neat correspondence in the style, which I'll point out later.\nInterpretation 1: cut and paste\nThe most basic reading of the story is in a straight, \"publishing-chronological\" order: in the order of how anyone might have read them as they went up on the site. Because of the \"shape\" this seemed to map out in my head, I've called this the Central Line:\nThis order is simple and easy to follow, but the overall story doesn't make sense in this context. Most people are used to chapters arriving out of \"story-chronological\" order in a book, though, and would therefore try and rearrange them in their head so that they made sense.\nInterpretation 2: two separate stories\nSo: a first step in making sense of the chronology might be to split the story into its two clearly-defined parts. Of course, pretty much anyone who has ever read a novel (outside of some drivel by Kathy Lette or John Irving) will be able to follow the fairly basic concept of \"chapters not necessarily arriving in the order they happened.\" But I'd like to think that the looseness with which I wrote the story means that, when splitting the story up in order to start reconstructing it with a sensible time frame, one is actually able to come up with a valid interpretation of the story, as two separate stories, that may or may not (modulo authorial intent, which is anybody's guess, even mine) have been the way I meant things to be interpreted. In other words: if you can't be clever, then at least don't rule out the possibility that you are.\nAnyone who has ever tried to get to Mornington Crescent will know that the bifurcation of the Northern Line makes it confusing to navigate and comprehend. So this interpretation is named after that line:\nAgain, the independence of the five stories easily permits this combination to be actually interpreted as two separate stories. Lovely, if a bit strained by one branch only having two stories.\nInterpretation 3: before or after\nComparing what Oliviero Paio says with what Jon's boss tells him, it is possible for the London branch of the story to either precede or succeed the other branch. If the London branch occurs first, then Jon could be sent to spy on Mr Barnaby; if the Spanish branch is first, then Paio has asked Dr Harris to send Jon on the basis of Barnaby's delivery.\nFurthermore, there are a few hints from the characters at a repetition of the plot they are embroiled in over and over again (albeit with different couriers/spies, of course). I've decided, mostly because of this potentially infinite tit-for-tat spying that could be going on, but also because it encapsulates the two interpretations in the preceding paragraph, to lump all of these together as the Circle Line:\nThus we have a courier who arrives with information in Spain, and on this information someone is sent from London to follow another courier to Spain, who in turn outwits his tail and arrives with information.... \nInterpretation 4: the same person\nThe final interpretation I want to bring out is the following and isn't obvious: the entire story is based around a single person, a courier called Jonathan Barnaby. This courier is sent by his boss in London to Spain with important information, and on the way believes he is being followed. He strikes out on foot to shake off his pursuer, and eventually meets with Oliviero Paio to deliver the information. Let's call this the District Line:\nI'd have preferred the second interpretation above to be called the District Line, because of its division of the story into two separate locations. In the end, though, the Northern Line most suited the structure of that interpretation, if not its content. And the same is true here: why? because, as on the London Underground itself, the District Line is a kind of \"special case\" of the Circle Line, that does not connect up to form a circle, but terminates instead.\nResults\nI have no idea where this is leading, or how much it could be expanded. If this faintly whimsical game were to be played in an entire novel, then one might have a masterwork, or alternatively a confusing mess; or worse, something reminiscent of a choose-your-own-adventure book. Let us all pause for a moment, to shudder. I also have no real feeling for whether this vagueness permits the reader to stretch their own powers, as a reader; if instead it just makes them feel rather neglected, starved of a stricter structure.\nWhat I have learned from this, though, is that I can write better stories if I can try and get individual chapters to speak for themselves rather than acting as fillers for others. No doubt a future experiment will teach me that, in some circumstances, the precise opposite is true. At that point I will have to start all over again with trying to figure out how to write anything longer than around 800 words.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/little-bit-espionage.html"},{"title":"Make it to the bus stop","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    19 Sep 2001        \n        \n\nSlowly, dully, Jon put on his other sock, all attention absorbed in manoeuvring it over his heel. Hands on his knees, then elbows pointed forwards, as if about to stand up. There was a pause, a long pause, too long. The radio-alarm clock clicked on once more and blared noise, rousing him again. This time it pushed him with its nonsense to the sink, where he stared at his barely-bearded face.\nBrushing of teeth was accompanied by the motion of very few thoughts indeed. Tortuously he shuffled through what he could remember of last night. Apart from singing to an unwilling audience in The Fox and Hounds - which had already struck him on waking up - there was nothing else to cringe over, and he put down the toothbrush, spat one last time, and began to shave. \n Shaving began as slowly as anything else so far. Painfully slowly, so as not to be painfully quick. It sped up, however, when Jon remembered with a start that his neighbour from upstairs, Alan, was working nights and due home - check watch - any minute. Alan was as devoid of virtues as he was apparently full of things to say. He collected \"transport memorabilia:\" Dinky cars, buses and trains; old bits of London buses and Hackney cabs; tube maps from all over the world. The slightest hint of the subject would draw him to it immediately. And, once begun, it was difficult for Alan to be stopped. \n With this in mind, Jon shaved faster. He nicked himself twice, once on a smile line - that cut would not heal for some time unless he could find reason not to smile. Towelled off of stray soap, he threw on the rest of his clothes and left the house. \n He decided to take a longer journey to a different bus stop, that he might avoid Alan coming home. Detachedly he watched the pat-pat-pat of his trainers as they steadily consumed the pavement ahead of him. For a block or so he wondered why he was acting hungover when his head felt fine, at a distance from it all as it were. After going over the same thoughts several times, his memory finally revealed that he had been smoking pot last night. Harris would not approve if it came to his attention. Pot always slowed Jon down the day after. It killed the pain of hangover, too, but substituted for it a drawn-out nausée, which painkillers clearly couldn't touch. \nThat was it. The face of Christ in a rock formation, the wracked bodies of men in old, dead trees: barely recognisable as what they clearly are until the pattern is finally overlaid, meshwise, by the brain. Then the images are inescapable. Thus did Jon suddenly perceive the fog of his paranoid fugue, that cut off sight of his feelings and rendered him shallow and animalistic. Seeing it, though, did not mean he could fight through it. \n He was surprised to find himself already at the bus stop, suddenly waiting. As he stood, and shuffled, he tried alternately to smile politely at, then deferentially ignore, two bundled-up old women sat a few feet from him. They exchanged a look, and the bus arrived. \n As he dropped into his seat, the floor dropped out of Jon's head, and he felt a vertiginous plummet. Down and down he fell, like in a dream, and he felt worse and worse with each passing fraction of a second. As the dive ended in a pit of a grubby despair, Jon guessed that his dope hangover may have been worse than he had first suspected.\n \"Bad night, Jonathan?\" asked a voice next to him. \n Perfect timing, thought Jon, and looked to his left, seeing there sat next to him his superior, Dr Harris. How much did he know? Could smoking pot cost him his job? Or could he pull off the demeanour of a hard-bitten service type, driven to the occasional snifter so as not to arouse suspicion amongst his target: Billy Dean, gunman on the Falls Road; or Jerome LeBlanc, international mercenary; or Leon Marakov, Russian embassador and spy? Jon decided none of this would wash: Harris preferred John Le Carré to Jack Higgins, and either Amis to both of them. Was he a fan of Conan Doyle?\n \"I've felt better,\" he managed. \"Sir. Are you following me to work now?\" \n Dr Harris smiled; round, thick spectacles gleamed. \"Of course not, Jonathan. You're much better at that than me. No, this is just happy coincidence.\" Jon grimaced. \"We have a new commission. Ideal for a sly cur like yourself.\" The smile became a grin.\n \"So soon?\" \n \"Yes, I know, dear Jonathan. Keeps you on your toes, though. Earns you your leave. We only received confirmation of this yesterday evening, though, and I didn't want to disturb you and your chums or I'd have had you out of your evening's R-and-R there and then.\" \n Chums. Dr Harris couldn't resist hamming it up. Jon sighed, defeated. \"Where to now, then, sir?\" Harris pulled his newspaper from under his arm, patted Jon with it in the chest. \n \"Spain,\" he announced.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/make-it-bus-stop.html"},{"title":"Momentum","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    22 Mar 2004        \n        \n\nHe got out of the car slowly, waiting for one foot to touch the kerb before the other one was lifted off the mat that rode up against the pedals. His knees resisted with a stiffness that was almost entirely psychological. Old now, for certain, but feeling it more in his head and heart than his veins and joints; old from the top down, as if the grey in his head had soaked into his brain, and thence to his blood and his knees. He began, ponderously, to straighten himself out of his seat, and under his corduroy trousers he was certain he heard a cartilaginous crackle.\nClump, went the door. There was a time when he would have walloped it shut and spun on his heel. A time when the car body he could glimpse in the corner of his eye would have had the glorious bulbs and swoops of a Daimler, instead of this Japanese... thing he had been forced to buy in retirement. Casio, or whatever in God's name it was. Shaking his head he began to shuffle the hundreds of miles to the shop front.\nInside the shop Mr Harris was swearing. Specifically, he swore about stock ordering that had slid entirely from the surface of Jamal's mind. Jamal was his nearly-new (or shop-soiled, as Harris often called him) employee, who had forgotten to buy in as he had been told, and reminded, and reminded again. As he saw Mr Friedrichsen approaching Harris moved smoothly to swearing about that instead. Oh Christ, he thought. That old bugger. It must be after eleven, then.\nThe bell tinged.\n\"Morning, Mr Friedrichsen,\" Harris intoned, acknowledging the man with words and the daily ritual with voice.\n\"So, Harris,\" said Friedrichsen. It was meant, as always, to be a greeting; he clipped each word as it left his mouth and coloured it with an accent that wandered around middle and eastern Europe like Napoleon's army, getting thinner whenever Friedrichsen's thoughts on a subject frosted over.\nHarris folded newspapers and flopped them down on the counter in front of the old man. He punctuated the process with the titles of the publications. \"Telegraph, Figaro and Die Zeit. And a pack of extra-strong mints?\"\n\"Ach, no,\" Friedrichsen said, waving a finger at Harris' mistake. \"End of the wik. Not today. Nefer today, by hwich I am meaning this day of the wik!\" Harris tried to smile and largely failed, but providence sent him his wife at this point, who could talk to Friedrichsen as well as she could talk to any one of their customers: very well indeed.\n\"Mr Friedrichsen!\" she cried, as if the old man didn't come into the shop every day, but had instead been absent for years. \"Nice to see your face! I hope life's treating you all right?\"\nFriedrichsen bowed stiffly, his back lacking gallantry. \"As well as is to be expected, yes?\" He smiled warmly to indicate it was a joke. Dutifully, masterfully, Mrs Harris giggled.\n\"Ah, that's good to hear, isn't it, Phil?\" (No pause for an answer) \"I think that's all you can really hope for, isn't it? As well as can be expected! I just hope you don't get this flaming cold that's been going round, is all. And any news about your kids, Mr Friedrichsen? Not that they're kids any more, I suppose!\"\n\"Ach! Do not ask me about them!\" he said resignedly, glad they had asked. \"The girl she is not so good a dotter, spending her time and my money with these... artist types in London, but.... she is young still, yes? Still time, I am supposing. My son, though. Ah!\" He turned to Mr Harris, one father to another. \"Dat boy of mine, eh, Harris? Hwat can you do with setch a fool as he?  Hwen the world and his wife are forsakink the countryside in drofes, drofes I say, he returns to it, end to his rrreckless, stupid climbink. How bleak it all is, where he and she are lifing. It almost makes me glad, that he nefer haf infited me.\"\nHarris was at a loss. Mrs Harris stepped in again: \"I'm sure they don't mean any harm by it, Mr Friedrichsen. We were all young once, and I'm sure they're having fun learning from their mistakes.\"\nWearily Friedrichsen nodded his wrinkled head. \"You are right, Mrs Harris. I am certain that Mrs Friedrichsen, Got may her soul rest, would say the same. Yet I wish they could be learning from my mistakes sometimes, perhaps! Till tomorrow, Mr Harris. Good day, Mrs Harris.\"\nAgain the door rang its little bell and he was outside. They watched him stalk, chin held high against the world and its youth, back to the car.\n\"Poor sod,\" Mrs Harris said quietly.\n\"Poor sod indeed,\" Mr Harris said. \"Those kids are better off away from him and his bleeding edicts. Dictatorial old swine.\"\nMrs Harris just smiled and returned to the back room, again on cue like a weather-house figurine.\nTurning back to the counter, which he had been in the middle of tidying, Mr Harris continued to talk as if his wife were still there. \"If nothing else the old boy must be well-read, I suppose. I wonder what his son's like. God, if I had had that waiting for me at home every day then I'd have cleared off too.... What's that- Jamal!  Jamal!

To state what is unusual is easy enough; it is, in fact, a trait common to your people and mine, to take note of events which take us by surprise. But to describe the very hegemony that rules every day of our lives is far harder; not to fall into the trap, of assuming that what is obvious to us must also be just as clear to you, is the danger that I must brave again and again as I compile the record that you may now, I hope, be reading. With this in mind I crave that you excuse my impudence in beginning with so bold a statement as that with which I must now furnish my narrative: I do so in order to shatter and disperse your preconceptions and my complacencies in equal measure.\n       We—that is to say my people—live in rooms built from the silted-down cast-offs of the dreams dreamt by you and your kind. My compatriots and I—yet we have no true country, no father- or motherland—inhabit some ten billion interconnected caverns, each of which is perpetually constructed and reconstructed by the remains of what you once imagined.\n       Such a brazen statement—at first glance incomprehensible (to you)—no doubt needs further explanation. Accept for now, however, that your dreams, once enlivened, do not die when you wake; rather, each continues a separate existence separate from both the dreamer and his or her recollections. For each of your world's souls (if you will forgive my rather fanciful terminology) there is a room in ours, and an occupant; this room is furnished with those corresponding dreams, and its occupant nourished and entertained with them, and together both lodgings and lodger provide the final resting-place for whatever the dreams become.\n       The process by which this protean stuff leaks out of your world and condenses in ours is obscure, and our scientists and philosophers (such as we have, for our accretive universe is conducive neither to science nor philosophy) have yet to agree on even a theory, let alone the precise details. Our world is barely understood as an allegory of yours, or as a more surreal mirror, that colours your events with whimsical, ornate details; rather, its very nature utterly reinterprets the slumbering imaginations of yours, transforming it into substances and objects that the dreamer could never predict—\n       Forgive me! Such convoluted and queer imaginings must make little sense to you. Permit me to illuminate instead with an example. I must begin by explaining that our term for an individual inhabitant of your world is \"factor\", a name which acknowledges the role they play in ours. Let us consider such a factor dreaming of being chased in a condemned mansion. Their pursuer wishes to do them harm, and as they run or, more frighteningly, pace behind the factor's dream-self, they wield a polished, heavy knife with sinister intent. They turn down one gloomy, slippery claustrophobic corridor after another, their legs feeling more leaden every minute. Fear clumps together into an almost tangible, sweaty clod in the pit of their stomach. Suddenly, as the hand of their enemy is on their shoulder, they wake with a start and, some moments later, they have almost entirely forgotten the sensation of being chased, that awful anticipation, the glint of their enemy's weapon.\n       In the mean time their counterpart, in our world, has become aware of the dream. They never perceive it directly, but rather catch peripheral glimpses, as though of a sound heard through tinnitus or of a flash seen out of the corner of an eye. Thus forewarned, they sit and wait. Before their eyes, their accommodation is presently augmented with (for example) new castors on their writing-desk; a black, drooping pelmet flutters over the top of their curtains; and the light beside their bed burns fiercely bright. Such are the fates of the respective components of the dream: the pursuit; the fear; the flashing blade.\n       Can you imagine an existence in our mutable, unpredictable world? Where dreams settle, condense and ultimately become concrete, only to be ground back down into dust by layers of more and more dreams? A world where one day the fabric of one's reality might flutter, billow and then suddenly change like the sheets on a bed? In such a world, society as such is impossible; politicking, punishments and governance are worthless concepts when one is largely, if erratically, provided for, and when our populace is neither fixed nor controllable by our own actions, concerted or individual. Our only firm grasp on an utterly changeable universe consists of a concerted attempt to infer the more predictable structure of yours.\n       To this end, a number of us have begun cataloguing the experiences that leak through into each of us of the dreams that ultimately form his personal space, at the same time as you yourself perceive them. They—or perhaps I should say we, for I must count myself among these obsessives —also attempt to compile descriptions of as many literary and cultural artefacts as our rooms are furnished with, so that we might discern common patterns that hint at their origin. Though we are confounded and bamboozled by our own physicality—our history books turn into housebricks, or our inkwells sprout spidery legs and wander off—we have nonetheless made some recent advances in our studies, and now fully comprehend such diverse aspects of your reality as shipbuilding since your recent \"Industrial Refutation\", many aspects of the current racial tensions in your New World countries, and how to effect the baking of porcelainware.\n       Yet even with the combined efforts of all our \"historians,\" much about your world remains unclear. We do not know precisely how the people there procreate, although there is a widely-held belief that one half of your population has the ability to whisper gently and amiably into the cupped ears of the other, and thus in some way initiate gestation.\n       Unlike in the world that has fashioned ours, the inhabitants of ours never gestate: they are not born, and they do not die. Rather, each is first discovered—by himself, by others—wandering somewhat confused in the locality of his room. Indeed, it is by finding the occupant that we usually find the room itself, its newly-minted door normally indistinguishable from the walls of our catacombs. We shepherd the fellow to his lodgings, where he makes his home, subject to the whims of furnishing and sustenance of the connection to your world.\n       Eventually, his factor's mortality runs its brief course, and it becomes clear to our comrade —whether by the changing substance of his dream-accretions, or simply by a sort of instinct—that the dreamer has died; yet the process of construction continues after death, although at a vastly reduced rate. Death does not stop the dreamer from dreaming, though most of your acquaintance would no doubt presume otherwise!\n       For as long afterwards as anyone has cared to record (and the eldest among us, whilst these days being a good deal more addled than even the most confused of foundlings, still try to retain the most basic inventory of their surroundings) dream-experiences continue to trickle through into our realm, as rainwater and soil might collect in the dreamer's hollowed-out head. At the same time such structures, colonnades, gardens, chairs, writing-desks, kitchens, pots, pans, samovars and all the rest, as have already been put in the room: these remain for ever, and their construction begins to ossify and set in a way which is hard to describe but plain to apprehend.\n       So what remains to be done after the factor's apparent death is the addition and correction of small details. One of us might arrive in their otherwise completed room one day, only to receive from their dead counterpart a brief notion of tree branches waving in a fresh, spring breeze. If they were to then make an inventory of their room, they might spot bright, bejewelled eyes on the carving that has adorned their walking-stick for decades. Or, with a shiver that penetrates to his marrow, they might find themselves unable to shrug off an amorphous feeling of limitless and perpetual darkness; when, unbidden, this experience eventually fades, there might be another grape on a vine, a few more buttons on a pearled jacket, or a faint, ungraspable tinkling of bells when one turns one's head. After the apparent death of the factor, these ornamentations appear less frequently in the room as decay follows its natural course; yet they never seem to fully cease, and one will always eventually be surprised by some unostentatious novelty, placed almost lovingly in the room like flowers by a headstone.\n       Our world seems to exist entirely as a concreted effect of your world's intangible causes: we sit in chairs, and breathe in perfumes, and eat breads and meats, that once had fantastical and entirely other existence in your heads. It is not known whether there might be some hope of communication in the other direction: from us to you. Yet much as your hopes and desires have taken on physical if incomprehensible aspect in my world, so have my hopes of such a connection been placed in this brief document. I crave that, with the perspective granted you by both your dreaming and waking worlds, you might appreciate ours more than any of us are truly able.\n       Though in some ways our world appears melancholy and without direction, yet the unintentional gratitude of you and the billions of other factors permits us to study and learn. Our only tragedy is that we ourselves can never dream—to where would our dreams fly when we wake?—but we have much to console ourselves nonetheless. We spend our time fashioning miniature and baroque word-games, logic puzzles and other intellectual trivialities, which though today mean nothing and tomorrow might mean even less, are nonetheless inspired by, and built upon, what you offer us. I personally have read what I believe are many classics in your literature—cheered on Raskolnikov as he denounced the prosecutors, wept for joy at the reconciliation of Kurtz with his ageing parents and his first love—all of which have been provided, if unintentionally, by your grace.\n       With this in mind I offer you, my factor, some small recompense. When I have finished this brief description of all that we know and feel, I shall place it in the centre of my own room. Let it be my humble gift to you, the great architect of my beautiful accommodation; though (and this alone I know to be true, for my heart tells me so) you lie deep interred, still your sleep of earth and your dreams of soil conjure my walls, my chairs, and even the scents on the air which I breathe. Let some essential spark of you comprehend our existences and the debt of mere being which we owe you. Let all this reach you as you moulder in your grave (as we shall never do): not dead, merely dreaming.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/mortar-dream.html"},{"title":"To a mouse","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    11 Mar 2011        \n        \n\nWee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie,\nO, how I wiss ye'd na been hasty!\nYe'd still be eatin pyles richt tasty\nAn' rinnin roun'.\nI'd then be laith tae scaith thee, mousie,\nLike some daft loun.\nI'm truly sorry man's unfeelin'\nDid nick thy life with wee, fley'd squeelin'.\nIt leaves my senses all a-creelin':\nWae's me!

The thing was, he was a plumber, so he had to go round people's houses, you know, to fix their boilers or whatever—\"\nI nodded and grunted something that meant: our boiler stopped working recently, and the house was bloody freezing for days.

Hated it.\"\nWe changed back into the left-hand lane as we approached a roundabout, and started to slow down.\n\"Funny, really,\" he continued. \"He never saw me do any of this stuff.

Thing is, I suppose he'll never know, now....\"\nThere wasn't much I could say after that. A heavy weight lay across the conversation for a few moments and the roundabout loomed closer. I just frowned a frown that he probably couldn't see. But we were suddenly both distracted by a van powering up the outside lane. As it came alongside, we could both see the big red lettering on its side:\n     A & J — PLUMBERS \nIt hared round the roundabout with barely a touch on its brake, shot into the turning opposite and was quickly lost in the traffic. As we stared after it, of course we were both thinking: the old man knew exactly what his son was up to, all right.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/near-side-side-other-side.html"},{"title":"The Nightmare Sonata I","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    18 Jan 2004        \n        \n\nThe rain wet the brick and wood; over years the brick and wood had split and softened, to let water seep through to the furnishings and artifacts of humanity the building had long since stopped being a shelter for. A slew of the downpour burrowed relentlessly into the filth that was once a corner of the carpet, in a draughty room where Luke and Jessica sat, crouched, huddled and hugged together. Each watched the other sleep, taking turns to shake the other out of their inevitable narcoleptic panic. It had been six weeks since the nightmares had come to every person in the world.\nLuke was dozing now, far above the currents of revitalizing dreams. As he looked down inside himself, he felt that he could every other flow of sleep poisoned now, a sea marbled with abominations and malevolence. Eyes steady, breaths passing through the room regularly as the clocks that once ticked away time awake and time asleep. Propped awake by love and driven to obsessive attentiveness by deprivation and fear, Jessica felt as though every inhalation passed over her face, and every exhalation rattled the windows. She timed the pause between each, worrying away at the notion that panic might have infested Luke's system and she had not missed it. It gnawed back at her, the possibility that she might already be too late, Luke gone, lost to her, a mixture of too little sleep and too much of the nightmare, the new cocktail driving everyone out of their minds.\nBehind his eyelids---did they flicker?---Luke was wrapping his thoughts up like a broken limb. If he'd have been in his father's generation he would be counting sheep. His father never knew anything like this, though, he said to himself. Then the last thing he did awake was to pulling unconsciousness around himself like a thick, soft blanket: heavy, warm, dragging him down, down, warm, down....\nJessica heard Luke catch his breath. Just the once. Then a slower, shallower rhythm. She steeled herself. A quarter of an hour, of the sleep he needed, they both needed, sucking like honey or milk; then wake him before the toxins surfaced in the supply, a stirred-up sediment full of headache and madness. She strengthened her stare, as if the gaze of her eyes alone could constitute a raft for Luke to climb onto, negotiate the treacherous waters ahead. Oblivious to the pouring rain and the far-off shouts of crazy men she rememorized the smudges and bristles on Luke's once pretty face. They had both been pretty once. Without noticing it, and without looking for a moment away from her husband, she began to weep tears; they raced, each one alone, down her rapt face.\nLike switching on the lights in a dark warehouse, a dream started to fill up Luke's head. Fluorescent flickerings, one far in the distance, then one close to. He began to think about when he was young, his father the farmer. A sunny meadow, running across it and he convinced himself he smelled the grass and his own child-sweat. Every dozen strides he tripped over a divot in the field, twisting his ankle but it didn't hurt, couldn't hurt or he'd have woken up. Sometimes he would trip and float, reach the ground yards ahead of him before sinking onto it.\nIn the distance was a cottage. It was so far away, whitewash white gleaming back at him, a focus that the day was revolving around. Every leap should be taking him closer, but the cottage was still at the same point near the horizon. He tripped and flew, and there was no difference; he ran on, and there was no difference; he tripped, looked down, and when he looked up again he was suddenly inside.\nCompared to the gold and vibrancy of the field, the cottage felt oppressive. Each wall seemed to breathe rot and old plaster towards Luke, much like the room in which Jessica still watched over him. He knew where to go, where he had to go, and took silent steps towards the foot of the steps leading up to the attic. From the ceiling came a rustle and a shifting of weight. Heavy, human weight.\n---There. That last one. Was that rushed? Was Luke now somewhere else, breathing in some other mildew? Was he walking slowly up the stairs yet? Jessica bit her lip. At the beginning they had both told each other of their nightmares, before the curse had thickened and become so strong that they had to wake each other up. Should she wake him now?---\nThe slash across his body, from right hip to left ear, digging through bones and arteries. Jessica had always rescued him from it, but in his guts he could feel it as if it had already passed close to them. In those guts something said: death. His heart hammered. His head had steel hoops, tightening rocks against his temples as he got to the top of the stairs and stood in the darkness and there was a swish behind him and then he was awake and Jessica was shaking his shoulders; through tears of worry and fatigue she was stammering as quietly as she could. \"Luke\", she said. \"Luke. Come on. Wake up.\" He continued to surface, rising to wakefulness as his heart rate and blood pressure lowered themselves to meet his mind half-way. Close, as usual; not too close, and at least Luke had had fifteen---or was it twenty?---minutes' sleep.\nNow it would be Jessica's turn. Luke knew that she could have a little longer than he could (but she needed it more). The cycle could then repeat: fifteen for him, twenty for her. A dozen more iterations and one of them might be rested enough to leave the apartment, dodge the gangs, look for food.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/nightmare-sonata-i.html"},{"title":"The Nightmare Sonata II","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    27 Jan 2004        \n        \n\nShe hugged him to her, glad she had woken him in time. His mind had been falling, spinning like a plate, but she caught it, she did, before it cracked against this disease. No respecter of cleanliness or isolation was this plague of the soul, contracted by sharing vibrations. Everyone suffered, from its first night onwards. Nobody knew how or why it.... \n\"Why?\" murmured Jessica as she started to doze, moving her head to Luke's lap. He shushed and began to stroke her hair. How beautiful it had been! Spun gold, maybe, but that wasn't doing it justice. He remembered how it soaked up some essence of Jessica from the roots and lived in the air when she turned her head sharply. He remembered the sun catching it last August, bouncing off it to his eyes as if it could not spread the story of her quickly enough. He remembered all this as he fingered the lank strands, not washed since they had last found running water two weeks ago. Frowning he tried to love her hair again, and smiled a little when a tiny glow answered from deep inside himself.\nThere were shrieks outside. Marauding ranks of the now near-mad (for who of the truly mad would fancy himself in a group of crazy people?) were looting nearby houses. But this wreck, with its two wrecks, had already been stripped. Luke worried every time he heard sounds outside, but always had to agree with himself that they were safe here. In contrast Jessica only knew safety, wrapped up in his warmth and already asleep.\n... As a child Jessica had grown up on a country estate, and now inside the ropes and sinews of her head Jessica was as a child. She tripped lightly up the grand steps of her parents' estate, kept paved, carpeted, cleaned by her parents equally grand income. Over the grey stone, dusty even when it was not, she skipped towards her father. Dead for ten years but now here, he hugged her close and told her how much he missed her. She had been away, must have been somewhere, with friends or---\nCrying silently. There were always tears, Luke thought. That bit she always said she couldn't remember. The fear and shock---the sickness---always blotted out what had made her cry. \n\"He's in the billiard room,\" her father said, leading her by the elbow. He was always costume-dramatic, and she caught the bug from him and started thinking the same way. \"A suitor?\" she thought. \"A tutor? A pop star? She knew he'd been doing work for Apple---those haircuts, the clothes, the rich voices that drove a spike into her belly---and maybe he'd got talking over some... barristery thing. He'd come round for a drink of tea and a look round the grounds, or maybe the other one, the one she fancied less.... Bewildered (but not to the point of wakefulness) she let herself be steered to the doors. Standing before them and seeing their tallness, twice as tall as Denise her younger sister and dark with the wood of local trees, she suddenly realized who was beyond the doors. The notion opened in her mind like a container of ice, chilling her and freezing her feet to the floor, no, no, Daddy, no, it's not---\n---whimpering and wrinkling her nose, that was the cue, but how could he wake her now, God, she was pretty when she could get some rest. If he sat here and just stroked her hair, led a finger along her jawline, whispered he loved her: would that be enough? Would that seep into her skull and cleanse her? But as the doors creaked open and her father pushed her forward and the man in black came towards her and stabbed towards her heart, she only had time to feel the point of the blade against the skin of her belly when\nLuke woke her, wriggling her shoulders which wriggled back. She always woke in a foul temper, but still kissed him, to tell him, \"it's all right, I understand. Thank you. I'll thank you when I've woken up some more,\" the kiss said, but did not add that she might never be that awake again.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/nightmare-sonata-ii.html"},{"title":"The Nightmare Sonata III","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    1 Mar 2004        \n        \n\n\"I don't know, Luke.\"\n\"What can we do?

The one the brakes of the other, and neither can apply themselves: cannot yank the handle, stamp on the floor. Anticipating a grim resolution to the torture of fifteen minutes here and fifteen minutes there, the rain pushes against the windows and through the hole in the ceiling with renewed vigour. Their luck has run out: in five minutes' time they would both be mad.\nThere is a cry outside, not enough to wake them. As if picking up the smell on the air some fool shouts, victory! Another victim, and Another---but the shout doesn't break the spell. Dampened by the rain the voice swallows itself, and perhaps its owner goes back to smashing up a shop, or tearing into some packaged food in a vacuum of sanity filled up by hunger and fear.\nThe steps, the fields, the sunshine, the reunion. Like two television sets side by side they receive the first symptoms of the nightmare that trapped them both. Gladly he runs, gladly she is scooped up by her father. She remembers what his coat smelled like again, the rough tweed against her skin and she tries to hug him closer this time, knows any minute now he'll reluctantly move her to arm's length and look into her eyes and say that he's running towards the cottage, flying almost. The sun sits on the nape of his neck like a benediction or a warm hand---\n---A drop of rain has travelled all the way to the end of Luke's nose. As his head nods it wobbles, gains weight and then falls. Inside his head he is falling, tripping somehow towards the inside of the cottage, waiting to hear the sounds upstairs. He knows something is wrong. Somehow he's colder, in the land of Nod. Where is his guardian angel, he thinks dreamily, and then immediately wonders why: even in his sleep he knows the dream by heart and this isn't in it. Why is it different?\nWho is in the billiard room, she thinks. A pop-star? If it's a tutor, where's her suitor? Why isn't he here, she wonders; because he is looking at the rough farmhouse table, smelling the mould again, listening to the tick of a mantlepiece clock in vain. Although he is in this house again and again, it is always abandoned, never a foot across its threshold, and he is lonelier here than he has ever been before, treading softly across the tiles and waiting for the sound to lead him upstairs. His curiosity lies in wait, is snared by a shuffling as the doors loom before her, judging and finding a lack.\nLuke's head nods further forward and begins to loll towards Jessica's, resting on his shoulder and oblivious to the rain and motion. It isn't going to stop this time, he thinks, and it isn't going to stop, she thinks, both their hearts crashing like an orchestra as the steps pass him by floating upwards, and the doors open in front of her---\n---his head rests against hers---\nand at the top of the stairs, not behind him, not behind him is a man all in black but he's looking away at someone else, a young lady, and behind her multiple murderer is someone else, who leaps and he leaps on this intruder. Who rustled for so long in the attics of his head and kept him awake. Who plotted in the comfort of her ancestral home and spread a black stain over her eyes. This man drops his knife and raises his hands to Luke's arms (wrapped round his head) and she picks up the knife, and it is Jessica's hand, Jessica's, that plunges the knife through black cloth stretched tight over ribs, between ribs, deeper, into the heart, and Luke feels him struggle and stop---\nWith a start they leap apart. He breathes. So does she, gulping the air that wanted to wring itself of rain all the way into her lungs. Not dead in their dreams, not unsound in their heads. They sit for a while, drawing in breath and wondering at the miracle they dreamt up together. Their heads are now no longer touching but the secret still shared: if not the why, then the how....\n\"Shit\", he gasps. \"That's it.\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/nightmare-sonata-iii.html"},{"title":"O great computer!

Another day of wandering round, trying to be left alone, in vain. Every few steps Rhys would draw a bead from one stone to another, trying to lose himself in calculations, only to find either the line or his own body jostled by some gabbling pakamak. Rhys had been gloomily glad when the rain had started to fall on him, present as he was with no jacket of his own, as it gave him the excuse to quit, and not prolong his disappointment.\nHe made to go upstairs, then paused, as a thought began to form. He turned back and locked the door. The idea began to rush upon him that the day might not be wasted yet; that fired his muscles and raised the hairs on the back of his neck. Though he was still stood at the bottom of the stairs his mind was already up in his room, and his body had to catch up: quick. Hammering his feet on each step he could hear the blood pound just as hard in his ears, and felt his stomach drop away from him. He tilted forwards towards the top step and flapped his hands on the carpet to propel himself faster, flailing up in a four-limbed tangle; his mind was above, his lights down below, and his arms and legs all over the place.\nAt the top of the stairs, Rhys grabbed the handle, opened his bedroom door, left it to bang shut behind him, lifted up his duvet, pulled out the trunk, clicked its locks free, lifted the lid and grabbed the large scroll and purse within. He slowed then, arranging the objects with reverence, as if they were more than priceless: magical or masonic, full of invisible energy. He unfurled the scroll across his bed, weighing down each corner with four pebbles from the purse. He stuck his hand back into the bag to fetch more stones, and then stopped, weighing up the image that was before him.\nThe museums could afford their intricately carved models, but this paper map, wide as two arm-lengths and tall as one, was as useful to Rhys as any of them might have been. More so, for his purposes, for his design emphasized what theirs did not; indeed, could not, because the museum curators were uninterested to the point of blindness in what Rhys had discovered.\nAlthough the plan of the stones themselves still existed in thin pencil lines, occasionally redrawn and darkened where they had become too faint, such a detail was no longer the main purpose of the diagram. These mere details of geography were covered with lines in several different colours: green, red and blue for astronomical directions; but also two shades of purple and three of orange-to-yellow, each of which denoted a different flavour to a survey that Rhys had taken across the site, with shades of meaning that Rhys understood but could not put into words. Sometimes they overlapped with ley lines, or the paths between the nearby villages, or both; sometimes they had been made on a particular day, at a particular time, and produced an effect pleasing to Rhys. The trilithons, the Heel Stone, and the Slaughter Stone were all marked with deep-blue crosses, whilst the Aubrey holes, a circle of 56 post holes some 80 metres in diameter, were coloured in a particularly vivid red.\nRhys had guessed some time ago that each successive rebuilding of the stones had been a refinement on some principle of the previous construction. And what he had seen a few weeks ago—or, more precisely, not been able to see—had finally confirmed to Rhys what that principle was. As he knelt down by the chart on his bed, he tried to picture where he had been that time, and where he had been looking; with that in mind, even the scant and incomplete observations he had been able to make today might have some value.\nDeep in thought, he marked places from time to time on the map with flattened glass marbles. Often the juxtaposition of two or three or even four such markers led him to put another down in their centre, or on a particular axis of conjunction. Occasionally, with a triumphant flourish, he would take a ruler and pencil from his desk and affirm the arrangement with a permanent line.\nIn this way Rhys spent the next few hours playing what appeared to be some ancient boardgame against himself, thrilling at his own victories, excited even further by his failures. The day darkened and became evening; his parents came home and called up to him; the television went on, and once or twice the telephone rang; but nothing penetrated Rhys' concentration, as he wondered again and again about the next move he might make.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/o-great-computer-jupiter.html"},{"title":"O great computer!

Come in here a sec!\"\nHe lowered his outstretched arm, looking at the handle as if it were receding irretrievably from his grasp, breathed heavily a couple of times and then trudged back down the hallway towards his mum's voice. He saw his dad first, sat in the armchair, holding a mug of tea, smiling thinly. As he stepped into the room Rhys could smell cigarette smoke, which meant that his mum must be really nervous. She never smoked indoors, except when she did, which was usually when Rhys had been in trouble. He hadn't been caught doing anything wrong recently, though.\n\"We've got some news. Your dad's got that new job at Penny's—you know, the one he went to the interview for last month?\" Rhys tried to looked blank but vaguely interested. He remembered his dad had set off early one morning to catch a train from Salisbury station, but hadn't really paid much attention to where he had said he was going to. \"Well, they really want him to start as soon as possible, which is great, isn't it?\" She started talking to his dad. \"Especially with Moreton Electrics looking like it could close any day now.\"\n\"They'll want me to work out my notice, will Moreton, love,\" he warned. \"At least a month.\"\n\"Well,\" she countered, \"it'll take us longer than that to-\" She suddenly turned back to Rhys. He had a knack for receding into the background, she noted: it was easy to forget he was there sometimes, and he her only son! \"Sorry, Rhys, love, we were trying to tell you. Penny's is up in Worcester. That's a long way from here, nearly a hundred miles.\" Rhys' face was still calm. \"He can't do that commute every day, love.\" Rhys nodded, waiting for more information. \"We're going to have to move to Worcester.\"\nIt was at that point that Rhys' face started to move. First his eyes widened. \"We know you love it round here, darlin',\" his mum continued. \"But we thought that it might be better for you to have a change of scene.\" Rhys' mouth opened slackly. \"It's not healthy for you, going out at all hours. There was that trouble with the police as well. It'd be good to put all that behind you. And you'd be able to make lots more friends in Worcester. It's a lovely town, isn't it, Dad?\" His dad agreed, nodding his head; Rhys regained control over his face and started to screw it up instead, into a single frown. \"It's got cinemas, and a bowling alley. And there's a good college there that we reckon you'll get into if we all pitch in a bit.\"\nRhys was once again stationary, apart from his right hand which shook a little. \"Well,\" his mother said after twenty seconds had passed in silence. \"Don't just stand there with a look like thunder, love. Say something.\"\nRhys looked from his mum to his dad, and back again. He worked his mouth for a second or two, trying to form words. Then, finally, he could speak. \"No,\" Rhys mumbled quietly. Then, louder: \"No. No! No!\" Still shouting, he bolted from the room and out of the front door, not caring to close it behind him.\nBack in the living room, Rhys' dad had left the chair and was making to follow his son, when his mum put her hand out to him. \"Leave it, Paul. He'll be all right.\"\n\"At this time of night?\" his dad cried. \"It's pitch black out there and bloody freezing to boot. He'll catch his death.\" But instead of putting his shoes on, he stomped around the living room, knowing his son was hardier than that. \"And where the hell does he think he's going to get to any-bloody-way?\"\nRhys' mum sat down on the settee and sighed. \"Where do you think, love?\" she said wearily, and fished a packet of cigarettes out of her handbag. \"He'll go straight to the stones.\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/o-great-computer-mars.html"},{"title":"O great computer!

There could be no risk of being seen, he realised: neither the local police nor the curators would welcome any further intransigence on his part. He made fewer observations—he could conjure the stones both seen and unseen at will, which was more than the site itself could provide him with—and no experiments at all, so as not to raise suspicion.\nOne day, he knew, he would have to make it his last ever journey to the stones. The house move was in a week's time, and most of his parents' belongings were already packed. They hadn't been into his room yet, but he knew they would venture in there soon enough, with unflattened boxes, suitcases and tea-chests. He couldn't risk them finding his maps, even though they might not themselves lead to his secret. Besides, it would be a suitable day to bid his farewells, he decided: there was a planetary conjunction, and it was a perfect division of the times between both solar and lunar eclipses.\nSatisfied with the astronomical fitness of it all, he methodically tore his great drawings into strips, and the strips into rough squares. These he soaked to a pulp in the sink, and then ran the waste disposal unit. The flattened marbles he put in his pockets: he could drop those into the bins in the centre of the town. When there was nothing left except in his mind's eye, he left the house. At the end of the road he turned to look at his home in the distance, and murmured: \"Bye.\" Then he turned the corner and made towards the henge.\nThere were no mistakes: every step he trod across the site was accurate to the millimetre, so much so that he was sure he could sometimes see the outlines of the lines in his mind glowing in the grass under him. And they never saw him, any of them: not the tourists, the guides, the security guards or the curators; not even his parents, or his Auntie Jean's family; nor could the police find him, though eventually they came looking mob-handed, with most of Larkhill and a handful of journalists in tow. The local police were hardly the acid test for discovery, but if the paparazzi could not track him down, nobody could.\nAnd though there has been talk ever since, of a young man who haunts the stones; whom visitors sometimes swear they have seen out of the very narrowest corners of their eyes; whom the occasional nightwatchman might claim to have spied crossing the site at night, and followed to a sarsen only to have the figure before them vanish as if he had never been there; it was only talk, and nobody was ever to lay solid hand or convincing eye on the fleeting figure. Finally, for Rhys, everyone had gone away for good.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/o-great-computer-mercury.html"},{"title":"O great computer!

They littered the place, worse than the food wrappers, tickets and plastic bags they brought with them; they were lichen, clinging to everything and wearing it down. As the days grew longer in the spring, and he had more daylight in which to make his observations, so the number of people waxed too (although, even at the winter solstice, a dark and grim scrap of a festival, he could never find himself alone). In short, he wanted them all to go home or die, or to disappear somehow and never have been.\nIt belonged to him, he knew, even though he had never experienced it alone. He was like a rich landowner in possession of fields and paths that he could not fence off from the public. One or two local members of the landed gentry had persecuted Rhys in the past, so he had no sympathy for their privileged sort, but he was adamant that his situation was different: his blood and his bones yearned for that place; much as he owned it, it owned him.\nHe had tried on numerous occasions to be present when others were not; had surveyed the fields and the lay of the land during the day; had returned at night, intent on reaching the centre of the structure. But every time there had always been someone, some security guard or curator, vigilant at their post; Rhys, unwilling to provoke a confrontation, had always capitulated, sloping back into the evening and home. Only once, on a misty February morning, had he made the entire journey unmolested. He had left the house early, tramping a frosty dew into nothingness on the grassier fields, and made his way over barbed wire, through hedgerows and across ditches to the start of the Avenue by the cottages. From there, he had followed the entire true route to the site, curving round the way a procession might have done, and reaching the road near the Slaughter Stone. Emboldened by that lone success, he had tried the route a few more times, but always been spotted on protected, proscribed stretches; the last attempt resulted in a caution, and he dared not risk being banned from the site entirely.\nAs part of his daily and less adventurous routine there was a particular path that he took from Larkhill. It led him through the fields and across the Cursus, and in his mind's eye the gnarled, rootlike fingers that had cleared it so many years ago had never actually lost their vigour, nor turned into dust. Those hands still dug and toiled whenever Rhys thought of them, which was often. On this route, he would round the corner by Durrington Down Farm, and on a clear day the sight of the monument would always strike him as powerfully as the first time he saw it as a child. Those less eagle-eyed might not from that point spot the still tiny structure on the horizon. But he had acquainted himself with every curve and bank of the land for miles around; had grasped it warmly with his hands; had rubbed each green ridge with his feet until the earthy smell of times past was carried up to his nose, mixed with composty grass and animal dung.\nEvery time, he passed Mr Armitage's house on the way in; he always remembered how the old man had defended him once, when he had been caught by the police. Realistically, his mother had probably given Armitage a gentle nudge, as the ex-magistrate had always been sweet on her. She probably hadn't asked him to say what he had, though, as Rhys caught Armitage winkingly reassuring the police that \"the boy\" was feeble-minded but otherwise harmless. But Rhys didn't care. The old sod could think what he liked. They all could, if only they would all go away and think it somewhere else.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/o-great-computer-saturn.html"},{"title":"O great computer!

With time no longer on his side he decided to take a notebook with him to the site and back. It increased the risk of his discovery, but was necessary to speed up his studies during the month or two—perhaps even less—remaining to him.\nHe made several experiments based on his earlier observations. A position near the twenty-fifth Aubrey hole provided some solace, but only if he did not turn round: rotational movement gave him away. He found he could pass along the permitted sections of a route curving between the Station Stones to touch the edge of the South Barrow, and be utterly unnoticed as long as he kept moving. He repeatedly walked sections of this route, in between tourists and their cameras, or their cameras and the stones, but they all seemed oblivious to his passing (he wondered if they would even spot him when they looked through the photographs later). But when he stopped suddenly during a particular transit, made wary by an approaching official, he saw the looks on the faces of people nearby suddenly change: their eyes flicked towards him, and some of them even turned to gape at this young man suddenly in their midst. That route was not perfect, he realised, but it provided clues to perfection.\nBefore long his mind was a heap of geometry, shapes and paths lying round like fragments of pottery with thin straws between them. One day, with driving rain trapping him in the house, Rhys sat at his desk and stared out at the weather, willing it to improve so that he might return to his fieldwork. Then, suddenly, it was like a flashbulb had ignited in his brain, but a moment afterwards burnt out and disappeared.\nThat's it, Rhys thought. That's the place I'm after. I had it just now, but I lost it again.\nHe screwed up his eyes to concentrate, to try to sift out all the chippings and clutter that hid the genuine artefact, the shards that did not make up his prize. Like an archaeologist he peeled and lifted, and then brushed away the dirt from whatever was left. He stoppered his ears to the rushing, pattering sound of water falling outside and pictured instead the stones falling from the sky.\nHe saw the site, empty of its building work, the midsummer sun making the green grass lush and wet. Into this pastoral scene dropped rock after rock in slow motion, each shuddering and grinding to a halt as the others followed closely behind. Gradually, they built themselves up into an irregular pile, tumbling down and striking each other, crashing together and bellowing a clattering lament across his brain.\nFinally, with one last thump, the disorder he saw contained every stone that ever was placed, and some that never were, ones that Rhys himself would himself have placed given the chance. All the stones necessary for the perfect henge were there, the henge that would have made its purpose obvious to anyone.\nThen, as Rhys put his fists to his temples, the sun itself detached from the imaginary scene, and floated down into the centre of the mound, shrinking and brightening as it did so. At its touch, the stones rolled away, scuttling into position. One by one they put themselves in their correct locations as their builders had intended, leaving the now blinding point of light where Rhys now knew he would have to reach: there, precisely there, he could be unseen by and unseeing of everyone else in the world. Everyone else would disappear, and he would too.\nRhys opened his eyes at this realisation, and saw his goal clearly. To reach it was the puzzle now. There was no perfectly invisible route, he knew. But what was important was that, en route, nobody was to see him: he could accept, briefly, seeing others. And if he were visible in theory to the rather sparse crowds milling around, he could content himself on the journey with being effectively out of sight, with people hidden temporarily behind those merely physical artefacts, the stones themselves.\nIt was necessary to return to the plan. He closed his eyes again, and the completed structure was once again presented to him, a bright globe marking the point of perfect balance. Remembering each aspect of his workings and jottings in turn, he overlaid the networks he had discovered on top of the henge, the networks that the henge itself mapped out in secret.\nHe twisted and pulled at each of the lines between points, one by one; they barely yielded, but clicked instead from one archaeological socket to the next, like dislocating joints: 31st hole to Northern Low; Heel to the Great; blue to blue. He shifted his axes, pushed again, bent the spokes between Y holes and Z holes, brought his weight to bear on the path from the Avenue, and then, without any warning: joy!\nHe had almost everything he needed: the why, the where, and the how. Now he only had to wait for the when.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/o-great-computer-venus.html"},{"title":"One drink too many","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    7 Mar 2002        \n        \n\nThe drink goes all swimmy in your head as you stand up and move towards the staircase and the party. A dream lies heavy across your shoulders, a stole made from fuzz and lead. It forces you groundwards, pulling you from one marble step to another; you are like water finding its own level. As your feet move alternately (as far ahead of each other as your long skirt permits) your head seems to follow the line of the bannister, two feet above it, a smooth spiral that swoops at the last minute, propelling you into the people that stand around, clutching their drinks for dear life.\nYour feet touch the polished floor. Edward, in the closest group to you, says something inconsequential, a remark that lassoes you to his conversation. He's always been sweet on you, has Edward, and now he's talking, and you can feel your smile shining out like diamonds as you make some reply that you did not even give conscious thought to. At the end of a joke from one of his friends the rest of them sway as if caught in the wind, and billow towards you and away. You laugh too, watching yourself laugh and then make your excuses and guide your feet, or they guide you, across the hallway and into the living room.\nHere the crowd is thick and viscous, but parts miraculously before you, You wonder if it's something to do with how you look, like the mark of Cain upon you, but now you're seeing yourself from the outside and you can see you look fine. So you're now outside of yourself and you don't feel like you can get back. All your mental muscles feel weak and flimsy, no pull. You take the chance to have a longer look. The eyes aren't quite all there but that's probably the drink; you move towards the table for another but before you reach it or reach out for it Owen has placed himself in your path.\nYou could never resist talking to Owen, that brilliant smile, better even than your own. Even now, when your thoughts barely inform your movements, a muscle memory brings you sidling up next to him. You both talk and he gives you the full wattage of his teeth and his bright, bright eyes. You think perhaps he thinks maybe - there's something wrong - and he steals a glance to your left but says nothing. The words coming out of you are witty enough but you know they lack life and there's nothing you can do about it. You feel far away. Stepping over tangles of farewells you slowly retreat from him, as from Edward before him, and head towards the balcony for some air.\nThe stars stab through the blackness above you, letting in a cold whoosh of vacuum. It rolls across your brow, drying the sweat but not relieving your fever. Your thoughts are just pushed and blown through the trees as you stare, dumbly, at the too-clear sky. Behind you is the noise of the party, and individual voices and laughs push past you to leap from the balcony into the bushes and the night. Absent-mindedly you push your bracelet around over the skin on your wrist, brushing the light blonde down first flat and then bristled. As the wind travels past you one last time, the hairs bristle further and then further still as I look over your right-hand shoulder and, breaking the silence between us, start to talk. You: you just nod.\nI guide you again, this time back through the party. Without really knowing how it works, I manage to share with you the natural modesty of gait that makes me easy to ignore. We slide and hover through the talk and chatter, heading towards the front door. My hand is on your elbow, moving you gently forwards. I see your coat on the racks by the exit, strained tight by other clothes leaning on it. Putting your coat round you, I step to the door and open it.

He had taken to spending his lunchtimes in the gardens.

This was all the encouragement the student required.\n\"Look at it,\" he said, waving up at the church buildings and beginning to stride. \"The ideas! The symbology! Hawksmoor knew, you know. Glorious!  Theosophical!

He had begun his journey young, and almost exhausted his youth in travelling. Now he was nearly a man, but felt somehow still, in part, like a boy. He yearned to be young no more, but did not know how he might make that happen.\nFor many months the traveller passed through a hot, humid country, scattered with rocks and sweet-smelling succulents. On a day of particularly searing heat a great thirst came upon him, and he felt as though the skin on his bones might set aflame. As he rounded the corner of a mountainside which gave off its own chalky heat he saw, in the distance, a cottage with a run-down roof, surrounded by unruly fields. There was a horse tied up outside the building, and the sound of movement was carried over to him on the flat, heavy breeze. When he saw the horse drink water from a trough, the traveller could resist no longer, and stumbled down a rocky escarpment to the container of warm liquid. Falling to his knees at its side, he drank his fill.\nLifting his head after a time he saw a fat gentleman, with an apron over his clothes, looking at him with interest. The traveller knew a few words of the local language and stuttered a greeting. At first his new companion said nothing in response, and the traveller thought he might have misunderstood. Then suddenly he returned the compliment in a dialect of the common tongue, flattened and bent by the accent of the country. He welcomed the traveller to the region and also, as he explained, to his tavern. The taverner beckoned to the traveller to follow him into the cottage, and then walked through the door into the darkness beyond. The traveller swallowed in trepidation and his throat, now sated, felt tender as it clenched. Making up his mind he followed.\nThe taverner was already behind a wooden-topped bar, and reaching up to shelves for a little food. He asked the traveller if he wanted bread%u2014then corrected himself, and asked if he had money for bread. The traveller admitted that he did indeed have some funds, and jangled a few small coins onto the counter. This seemed to satisfy his host, and within moments there was food and drink in place of the coins. The traveller was hungry and ate rapidly, and all the while his host quizzed him about his journey, while the traveller in return asked questions about the area.\nThe traveller, leaving home at so tender an age, had never visited the taverns of his motherland and did not know quite what to expect. Its keeper, as he nonetheless had expected, sold wine, bread and cheese, and there were stools on which to sit and tables up to which the stools could be pulled. It was a custom of his own country that taverns would also let those passing through lodge for a time. After a minute's quiet he asked: did the taverner have any rooms to let? The taverner readily admitted he had three, above the public area in which they both currently stood. That made him an innkeeper, the traveller thought, as this innkeeper named a price. At this, the traveller's face fell. He admitted that he could not afford such an amount, and that the food before him had all but exhausted his funds.\n\"Well,\" the innkeeper said, rubbing the roll of stubbly fat under his chin and then round to the back of his neck. \"This is a quiet time for me. The cattle herders have headed south, and almost everyone from the local villages has gone to the city for the parades and fiestas. They will not return for some weeks. And so nobody is buying my wine or my cheese, and I cannot afford to let you stay for nothing.\"\n\"I can work for my board,\" the traveller pleaded. \"I can repair your roof and your chimney. My father was a carpenter, and I can work with stones a little. I can also help plough your fields, and make the tavern ready for when the villagers return.\"\nThe innkeeper had a simple soul. He also had lazy bones, and at the thought of so many tasks performed by the young traveller his face lit up with a smile. He agreed readily to this arrangement, and began cleaning some of the bowls behind the bar with a dirty cloth.\n\"You are a godsend, my boy,\" the innkeeper said. \"If you perform all these tasks you will certainly earn your keep and more. Though I have very little money to give you to help you on your travels, I will show you something far greater than money. I will show you the way to the most blessed stone cross, high on the nearby hill. It will be the making of you, my boy. It will make you a man.\"\nThe traveller's attention was drawn by this statement, and he asked the innkeeper: what was this stone cross of which the innkeeper spoke? The innkeeper explained that the stone was indeed holy, shaped out of the rock by the grace of God himself. He said that in that region for as long as anyone could remember there was told the story of a saint, the name now lost to time, who had walked up the hill as a penance, laden with all his belongings. Baking in the heat of a sabbath's midday the saint had prostrated himself before the stone. There he had found himself in miraculous communion with the Lord Almighty, who had told him a great and powerful secret. The innkeeper explained that he himself was now too old and too fat to make such a penance, and would probably expire before he reached the top. But the young traveller! If he were to make such a penance, reciting a prayer at each turn in the path, and reaching the summit just as the sun touched the peak of the hill opposite, then he too would learn something subtle and wise about the innermost heart of man.\nThe traveller could barely wait for the next sabbath in five days' time. Those days passed either slowly or quickly, the traveller couldn't tell, as he had to work hard for his keep and thus had little time in which to be distracted. The number of tasks that the innkeeper could find for him multiplied every day, now that the fat man could rely on an almost inexhaustible youth to perform them. He soon made good the roof and the chimney, and then found himself sweeping the tavern and its steps, and cleaning out the rooms. Although he was kept busy, each day he would step outside several times, only for a moment, to breathe in the clean air and gaze up at the hill; at midday, and before and after.\nSoon it was the evening before the sabbath, and the innkeeper and the traveller were sat inside the darkening room of the tavern. No fire was lit, for the heat of the day was still lifting off the bricks and drifting through the tavern. The innkeeper said to the traveller: \"Tomorrow is the sabbath. We do not work on that day and so in my heart I cannot ask you to work for me. Perhaps you should complete your penance instead, eh?\" And he pointed towards the mountain, and winked at the traveller.\nThe next day the traveller set out when the sun was almost over the peak opposite. The journey was long and arduous, as with his pack on his back and a stick in one hand he made his way in the waxing sunshine up the dry path. At each turn he would have to make himself remember to pray, and once, dizzy and thirsty, he almost forgot why he was even there. By the time he reached the peak his brain was misty with the heat, but in front of him he saw a stone in the shape of the cross. No sign of flintknife or sawtooth could be seen on its surface, yet it was unmistakably cruciform, balanced somehow on the end of its longest bar. He knelt painfully in front of the cross for some minutes, but felt nothing and eventually, disappointed, headed back down the hill towards the tavern. On the way down his legs ached far more than on the journey up, and he was tempted to throw his pack down the steep slope, and pick it up at the bottom.\nHe found the innkeeper waiting for him outside the tavern, and he asked what the traveller had seen. \"I saw the cross,\" he admitted, \"but nothing more. I did not feel God near me. The penance did not work.\"\n\"When did you set out?\" asked the innkeeper. \"Where was the sun?\"\nThe traveller pointed, as the innkeeper had done nearly a week before. \"Nearly over the peak of that hill there.\"\nAt this, the innkeeper shook his head. \"You must have set out too late. The sun must be at the top of that peak, when you are at the top of the other. That is how the saint arrived at the cross. But there is always next sabbath, if you want to try again.\"\nThe traveller agreed that he should remain in the tavern for another week. Six days now, they were spent by the traveller in yet more tasks set for him by the innkeeper. There seemed no end to the work that was available to be done around the tavern, as though it had been neglected for months or even years. Before the six days were out the traveller had cleaned every bowl, glass and plate in the tavern, and had moved wine barrels to and fro so often that he dreamt of their round, fat shape, and sometimes in his sleep thought of himself carrying the innkeeper up and down the cellar steps. Yet even with such a weight of work, the traveller made sure that each day at least once he looked up at the mountain, at the top of which he was certain he discerned the cross.\nSabbath's eve arrived a second time, and the innkeeper and the traveller were resting after the toil of the day. Sweet smells of blossom were blown through the tavern's open door, disturbing the stifling heat. The innkeeper said to the traveller: \"Tomorrow is the sabbath once again. Perhaps this time, if you are more careful in your penance, you will find the grace of God waiting for you at the top of the mountain. Now, though, you should rest!\" And he slapped his hands on the table, and headed off to bed.\nRemembering how long the journey took him before, the traveller set out somewhat earlier. As he clambered up the rocky slope, with his pack slung over one shoulder and a stick to help him on his way, he turned his head often to judge the position of the sun, and slow down when necessary. On one bend in the path he sat down altogether; after a few minutes, belatedly, he mumbled a prayer. As he lifted himself over the final brow in the path he found himself before the stone cross. He marvelled at its smoothness: clinted and griked in its shape, but polished beyond the point of weatherwearing as if once held by a divine hand. But tiredness as much as holiness made him drop in front of it, and he lay there for some time, before rising despondently and turning back towards the tavern. Loose stones and gravel scattered before him, making him stumble a little, and all he wanted to do was to throw himself, first into the horse's trough, and then into his bed.\nThe innkeeper was leaning on a hoe in the garden in front of the tavern, and he prompted the traveller with a simple: \"So?\" The traveller had to confess that, once again, he had failed to find God at the holy stone cross.\n\"Did you say a prayer at every bend?\" asked the innkeeper. \"Didn't I see you rest a while out by the ridge?\"\nThe traveller had to confess, to the innkeeper's disappointment: \"I did rest, but I said a prayer before I set off again.\"\nAt this, the innkeeper shook his head. \"You did not say your prayers properly. You must not rest first, but pray first. See to God before you see to yourself. But there is always next sabbath, if you wish to stay here until then.\"\nThe traveller agreed that he would continue with board and work at the tavern until the next sabbath. Once more he spent the days preceding it in working for the innkeeper. Once more the innkeeper found him task after task, which the innkeeper found easier after the fourth day when an old, toothless farmer turned up at the tavern. First the traveller was given the task of feeding now two horses, and then he chopped wood from the few trees that dotted the shadier slopes of nearby hills. He helped in cooking simple food for the farmer, who explained that the rest of the villagers were on their way, as he had set out early owing to his advanced years. Frequently the innkeeper and the farmer would drink late into the night, while the traveller (exhausted from his day's work) went to bed. But every day, however tired he became, the traveller cast a glance up to the hill with its cross atop.\nSabbath's eve arrived a third time, and the traveller was resting, while the innkeeper poured wine for the farmer. Outside the horses whinnied at scents carried on the wind, interrupting the quiet of the evening. The innkeeper nudged the farmer and then said to the traveller. \"Tomorrow is the Lord's day again. Perhaps this time, if you take more care over your prayers, you will learn a great truth from the top of the mountain. Now, though, you should get some sleep.\" And he poured wine for himself, and the traveller considered himself dismissed.\nRemembering his past fatigues, the traveller drank deeply from the trough of water before he set out, and packed all his belongings so that he might most easily heft them up the mountainside. As he picked his way over the path that he now knew very well, he tried to remember all the contingencies on his penance. He said his prayers promptly at each turn in the path, and judged well the time it would take him to reach the top of the mountain. As he approached the cross for the third time, he chanced to look over his shoulder at the valley below. He could see the tavern and the horses in the distance, and the innkeeper and the farmer were stood in the vegetable patch next to the building.\nThough it was a long way from the valley to the summit, the traveller's youthful eyes were keen, and he could tell that both figures were looking at the mountain; indeed, they both had their heads raised and could have been looking straight at him. As the traveller continued to watch the two older men, the farmer turned to his companion and slapped him on the arm. He said something, and pointed up at where the traveller was standing. At the end of the farmer's speech, both men seemed to rock and sway.\nAt seeing this, the traveller learned a great truth about his fellow man. As he began to appreciate this truth, he knew in his heart that he was no longer the young boy that had left his homeland. He shouldered his pack into a more comfortable position, took one last glance at the innkeeper and the farmer; he turned away from the cross and the summit, and away from the tavern and the valley; older, wiser, sadder, the traveller began his long walk home.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/parable-traveller-and-innkeeper.html"},{"title":"To pass the time (I)","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    15 Apr 2001        \n        \n\nShe sits squeezed into a leatherette window seat, feet up and gaze fixed unfixedly on the street outside.

He had had an inkling that Sir Alec despised him, even though Milhous was normally so wrapped up in either his work or the eagerness of explaining it to be able to classify a reaction from anyone. Sir Alec's interest in Milhous (or at least in Milhous' work) at the irregular but frequent meetings of the Club might fool others. They might work on those who made any measure of the human contact they made but, like a blind man seeing the soul so much more clearly in the voice than in the face, Milhous could tell exactly how Sir Alec felt about him. Sir Alec, Milhous imagined, probably spent hours of his day talking to people he despised, and Sir Alec was just as probably content to number Milhous among them.\nNow, all pretence of Club civility had been shed. Milhous was, despite foreknowledge, shocked to see Sir Alec's true colours before him: nasty, miserable shades of grey and grimness. If he could not talk in the tone of a businessman to this ur-businessman, if his words were not coloured that one particular shade, then he would be back on the street before he was aware what was happening. He looked down at the unassuming little box he was carrying - no bigger than a shoebox - and then up again at his host.\n\"Sorry, Sir Alec. I must, er, admit I'm a little nervous.\" He collected himself. \"Well, as you, er, know, I've had funding from the Ministry for years now, and as they don't, er, enquire into what I'm doing then I rarely have to tell them. Every few months I, er, provide them with a new patent and in return they leave me in, er, peace. They never feel the need to come to my laboratory, and so nobody other than me has ever seen what I've brought you until today.\"\nSir Alec leaned forward in his leather seat, which rumbled contentedly at the shifting of his bony frame. \"Spit-it-out-be-fore-I-throw-you-out!\" he ordered.\n\"A weapon. My, er, weapon. My device.\"\nSir Alec was struck dumb. Suddenly he began laughing, croaking, rending laughter that crashed out of him as if struggling to get free. As he continued to cackle Milhous began to look dejected. \"Is that it? Do you think that I, Sir Alec Delft, do not have access to whatever weapons I could possibly need? That I joined that idiot Club to obtain guns and bombs? Are you really that stupid?\"\nMilhous blushed. A little of the colouring was from shame, but it was clear there was anger mixed in there, a raspberry ripple of flame. Sir Alec checked himself. Perhaps, he thought, this queer fish standing before him had something of value. Lord knew it was about time that membership of the Club, with its communists, anarchists and plain kooks, should yield at least one result.\n\"Go on, Milhous. Please continue. I admit I may have... been a little hasty. What is it you've built?\"\nMilhous shifted the box slightly towards Sir Alec. \"The most powerful device you, er, might ever see, Sir Alec. A Doomsday device. The mechanisms within this-\" he lifted the lid of the box to reveal glowing metal and rivets \"-have the, er, power to destroy not just a building, nor a city, nor even just the world.\"\nSir Alec craned his head forward, a sudden thirst in his eyes. \"Are you quite serious, Milhous? Something so small?\"\n\"Is not a, er, word small, sir? Or the signature on a declaration of war?\"\nSir Alec just nodded.\n\"The mechanisms are, individually, quite simple. They consist of, er, several timing and positioning devices, er, linked up to the main circuit. Even that, though, is only a, er, fuse, if you like. The main circuit is connected to the laws of physics themselves, and turns matter itself into its, er, own explosive, spreading outwards from the device, not annihilating but in a sense, er, dictating self-annihilation.\"\nThere was a silence. A much less embarrassing one than before, and this time, although some ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed, Sir Alec had no desire to rid himself of the scientist. \"But...\" he began, astounded, \"what would be the use of such total destruction? I mean, to gain anything from such a... device, one would need to focus it upon those one would wish ill on. Can it not be directed at a single target? Surely it can?\"\n\"In principle it can be focussed, of course. But that, er, is not its primary function. I, er, built it as a Doomsday device, and that is what it is best suited to be. Focussing would yield clumsy and untidy results.\"\nSir Alec looked hard at Milhous. As he did so he tapped his fingers on the desk. He didn't want to ask the scientist why he had built a Doomsday device in the first place. Anyone who wanted such a device must have their heart full of malice, wishing death on so many others. Grimly Sir Alec could appreciate that and, nodding, he told himself that the scientist's motivations, however bitter and vengeful, were none of his business.\n\"Very well,\" said the knight with an ornate gesture of his hand towards the device. \"How do I activate it?\"\n\"Well,\" began the scientist, \"to talk of, er, activating this device is to talk at crossed purposes, really. Not that I am implying that it is anything other than fully operational; and not that I would suggest that one ought to have, er, moral qualms about setting such things in motion-\"\n\"Then what, Milhous?\" Sir Alec began to get impatient.\n\"Well, although I cannot possibly explain the, er, precise construction of the device to - begging your pardon - a layman such as yourself, Sir Alec, I would imagine you could readily grasp that, er, such a device would have to be very finely tuned. It would have to be sensitive to its environment to a very high, er, degree, in order to effect such a dramatic change on it. I think you realise what I mean: triangulation, synchronicity, planetary, er, alignments, that sort of thing.\"\n\"You mean I must just sit here with it, waiting for some zodiacal conjunction as if it were all ordained anyway? That's preposterous!\"\n\"Well, er, it's not so much a matter of waiting as positioning. One must position one's self, er, in both space and time. Think of it as, er, finding a lock in which to fit a key, or....\"\nBut Sir Alec had lost patience again, this time with no hope of getting it back. \"I cannot decide, sir, whether you be a charlatan or a madman. Either way, you are clearly a fool to think that I could possibly believe such ridiculousnesses about, of all things, a Doomsday machine. If one of us is insane, Dr Milhous, I assure you it is not me. Good day.\"\nAt the indication of some signal that Milhous could not see, the door behind him clicked open, and the assistant that had escorted him to the office glided into the room. For the first time Milhous saw that the young gentleman filled his suit admirably - too admirably, like a boxer made pretty for a charitable dinner. Milhous clutched the box like a life raft, and as the assistant began to lead him forcefully, if politely, towards the door, he suddenly stammered:\n\"I-I-I know, Sir Alec! I think I should warn you, I know! I know all about Elise, and I should warn you that you won't get away with it.\"\nLike a faithful hound the assistant was ever observant of Sir Alec's face for some sort of signal, and he suddenly saw a change come over it. It was as though a cloud had passed over the sun, although if it were a sun then Sir Alec's face was brittle and drawn: a sun caught mid-winter. The assistant paused in the act of frogmarching Milhous' suit to the door.\n\"What?\" It was barely a question, barely even a sound.\n\"Elise, Sir Alec. I know about her. I know what you did to her. She - she was my sister, Sir Alec. I won't let you get away with it, Delft. I won't let you.\"\nSir Alec's lips worked for a few seconds, as if he were chewing a fly.\n\"Get out!\" he finally screamed. \"Get out of my sight! Get out!\" he roared, finally unable to control himself. \"I will have you blackballed from the Club! You will never work for the Ministry again! If I have my way you will never work for anyone, ever again!\" As the assistant grabbed the scientist, and began dragging him to the door as if he were a sack of coal, Milhous shouted back at Sir Alec, and their monologues conflated messily: I know it all, make a fool out of me, your so-called reputation, leave you penniless, revenge, how dare you, tell the papers, threaten me, the end of you.... Then the door closed, with Milhous and Sir Alec on opposite sides.\nSuddenly Milhous deflated, miserable to the core. The assistant, whose name was Devlin, saw his quarry's resistance relax and ebb away. Deep down Devlin was a decent man, for all the indecencies he carried out on behalf of his employer. He let go of Milhous' shoulders, where he had instinctively grabbed for epaulets. Smoothing the material, he muttered something conciliatory and asked, could show the good doctor out to a cab? Milhous just shook his head, and tottered off towards the stairs.\nLater in the afternoon Milhous was slumped on a park bench. In the distance was the Delft building; in his hands, the box containing his invention. He stared at some point between the two, thinking hard. The hum of traffic passing along all four sides of the quadrangle pushed his thoughts gently from side to side, but he was suddenly roused by the sound of a church bell chiming three o'clock. He looked in all directions, finally settling on the box. Talking to himself all the while, he unpacked the device and began unfolding sections of its machinery. With only his own ears as audience his stutter evaporated, leaving measured, quiet words.\n\"I said, didn't I, Sir Alec? I said it was all a matter of positioning yourself in the right place, in space and in time. You don't have to wait around forever to do that, you know. You just need to have a good sense of timing.\" He extended a final piece of kit, like a radio aerial with a crosshair on the top of it. \"Timing, Sir Alec,\" he muttered, squinting through the crosshair at the skyscraper in the distance. His hands moved over a few controls. \"You either have it... or you don't.\" He pressed a button and smiled.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/power.html"},{"title":"Private eye","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    22 Mar 2010        \n        \n\nWhen he went out that day he left his keys on the table near the front door. They were quite a heavy bundle, and he was in the habit of declaring them a hindrance—when off jogging or heading out to the allotment—and asking her if she would definitely be around later to let him in. She would almost always say yes: usually it was true; even if not, small tasks could often be arranged. It wasn't just that she preferred to help organize his day; she just wanted to be around to let him in.\nThat day, though, he hadn't hollered up to her before leaving. He hadn't even told her he was going out; she noticed as he pottered from room to room, barely registering when there was a rustle of papers or a brief clatter of cupboard contents. The next sound she remembered was the front door closing: engrossed in a supplement of the newspaper, she hardly registered it for a few seconds, then caalled out to confirm an empty house: \"Matty?\" Silence.\nNow she was sitting at that table; a gateleg affair just tucked inside the living room, within throwing distance, and line of sight, of the porch round the corner. As such, it was the house dump; practically a utility room, at waist height, writ small. It held piles of papers, half-spent biros, bus timetables and office organizers crammed with useless stationery and old letters that might have once been important—wedding invites, or leaflets from the council about bin collection dates—had never been tidied or sorted. And a cracked ceramic saucer or dish, declaring its origin in blue brushstrokes as \"RODOS ~ Ρόδος\", containing a set of keys. Sometimes she frowned to herself; sometimes she lifted the keys to stare at them; sometimes both at once.\nWhere was he? What was he doing? And why had he left his keys? She tried to remember if there was some clue in what he had been wearing, but could only think in negatives: not his sports gear; nothing particularly smart, such as his work suit; yet not his old jeans and T-shirt, the uniform for a DIY day, either. Everything about him, his departure, and the day in general was an unremarkable blank: apart from the keys in the saucer.\nHer distracted, fretful gaze settled on one item in the room, then another, looking for clues. The sofa, with pale salmon trim on its darker pink cushions. The newspaper rack, spilling over much as it had done yesterday, and the day before, with glossies and leaflets. The mug without a handle, the tip jar they always joked about—\"if I got a tip like that I'd resign!\"—full of shrapnels of change, paperclips, a radiator key. The vase of flowers on the edge of the hearth, its rounded glassiness distorting the stems of the lilies and the cordyline. Then back to the mug on the table.\nIn among the coins, but only just, was a folded piece of paper, crumpled into a zigzag. From her line of sight it was almost invisible. She gazed at it for almost a minute, hoping it would somehow unfold itself or better still turn into an illusion from the jumble of stuff in the mug. After nothing continued to happen she reached over and scrabbled in the mug, pinching the note between finger and thumb and lifting it out.\nThe paper was a scrap, tightly folded, lined. As she turned it over in her fingers trying to distinguish fold from edge she spotted some of his handwriting, some of hers, and another hand she didn't recognize. Piece after piece, word after word, revealed itself to her presbyopic eyes—\"weekend\", \"bottle\"—until it became clear: it was a shopping list. It was their shopping list, and the third hand—recording some alternatives for what wasn't available—was that of the assistant on the delicatessen counter. She even half-remembered what she asked for, but couldn't remember if they found it elsewhere.\nBut, her interests in the table's contents now piqued, she began sifting through the piles of post, bills, empty envelopes, notes to each other and other paper detritus. Another foreign script: this time scratched over the wide pores of good-quality printer paper. She peered at the tiny, beetly letters, scowled briefly, then reached backwards to her handbag. She tilted the chair onto two legs as she stretched further, almost too far; then she gave out a thin creak of effort from between her lips, snatched the glasses case from the bag, and thumped forwards again, the chair legs grinding back into the carpet.\nShe snapped the case open and put on her glasses, big on-the-cheek lenses which flashed as they settled against her face. The writing was clearer now, something to do with work. But that didn't mean it wasn't a clue, she thought, as she scoured it for meaning. Only towards the end did it become clear the memo was about a new-client meeting scheduled several weeks ago, and moreover it had been written by Boring Andrew: not a blackmailer; not a spy; not another woman. She tossed the paper back onto the pile, faintly embarrassed at herself, and rose from her seat.\nOnly her legs were now tangled under the chair, her feet hooked round each other. One hand landed on the table top to steady her, and also rattled everything else on it, including the mug, some pens and an old boiled-sweet tin that she was sure had last been in the car. She sat back down, picked up the tin, rattled it experimentally, almost brought it close to sniff it, then twisted the lid off to reveal only a handful of old nuts and bolts; some paired, some forever mismatched.\nFed up by now, she tossed the tin and its lid back down separately, one from each hand and a little too violently. A nut skipped out of the tin and rolled away down the back of the table to some sort of freedom below. She didn't bother to reach for it and didn't start once again to get up and leave the room for the rest of the house. Her mind was once again full of questions: where could he be without his car, without even his keys; what street was he rolling round; who was he with? She tried to picture him returning, tapping on the glass pane of the door, looking sheepish, explaining. It'd be something and nothing, she was sure. And he'd be back any minute.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/private-eye.html"},{"title":"A quick Welsh lesion","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    21 Nov 2001        \n        \n\nWelsh is a rich, historical language. It was invented in 1953 by the Welsh comedian and astronomer, Griff Rhys Jones. His basic premise was to confuse American tourists who can barely speak English. As part of the fabrication of Welsh, Griff Rhys Jones wrote the \"Teach Yourself: Welsh\" book, which is colloquially known as \"Tyw,\" a Welsh word meaning \"without a grammar section.\"\nThe Welsh language consists of 22 consonants and over a hundred vowels. It is important to distinguish between the \"typical English\" pronounciation of any vowel, and the actual Welsh pronounciation. In Welsh, the \"e\" is pronounced like an \"e\", whereas the \"u\" is also pronounced like an \"e\", although closer to the German \"ü\". The \"a\" is an \"a\" unless it has a caret above it, in which case it is pronounced like an \"a\". \"O\" is pronounced like a \"u\", and \"y\" is either pronounced like an \"uh\", \"i\" or \"e\". \"W\", being a vowel in Welsh (except when it is a consonant), is pronounced like a \"u\", being a different \"u\" to the \"u\" that \"y\" is not pronounced like. In addition are certain double-consonantal sounds, some of which do not appear in other languages at all. \"Dd\" is a voiced \"th\", \"ff\" is an unvoiced \"v\", \"ll\" involves breathing through your teeth and \"bd\" is a sound rarely-used even by the most expert of Welsh speakers. The pronounciation is similar to the \"zh\" sound in \"pleasure\", but as it would sound during death by drowning. Many Welsh speakers are of a taciturn disposition.\nWelsh grammar is surprisingly simple. In Welsh, there are only nouns and adjectives. Verbs are frowned upon and articles and conjunctions eschewed entirely. So, for example, the sentence \"the cat sat on the mat\" would actually transliterate from Welsh as \"Cat sittingness mat uppermost surface\" (\"cathi eisteddfod y carped caead\"). Past tense is indicated by the word \"y,\" as is possessive, motion-towards, motion-from, position and metaphorical statements. Therefore \"it was the best of times; it was the worst of times\" could be \"Times (past) equivalent fraction best; times (past) equivalent fraction worst\" (\"Amseriad y rydwyw ffracsiwn gorau; Amseriad y rydwyw ffracsiwn trechu\"). No entire book has ever been translated into Welsh, although several prefaces have been managed to date.\nAs I have already learned from \"Tyw,\" Welsh is applicable in hundreds of everyday situations. It can get you a seat next to a pretty nurse who likes white coffee, or can let you tell people you are from Lincoln (even if you're not: they can't tell the difference!) And soon I hope to be able to announce my desire to try on a white skirt that is hanging in the shop window there, and looks very nice, but it is a little small, do you have one in my size. See what you're missing: why not take up Welsh today?\nA few resources for learning Welsh (for the sake of fairness)\nIt hasn't all been that bad, of course. A wonderful entry-level guide to Welsh (heavy on the grammar but I like that sort of thing) is maintained by Mark Nodine. Also, Dr Geraint Jones has a guide to the Welsh language's history and status which rather puts paid to mine above. Finally, if you really want to, you could do worse than pick up the \"phrasebook Welsh\" of the \"Teach Yourself\" guide, actually written by T J Rhys Jones, available from Books Online. The free tape includes a woman that pronounces \"pronunciation,\" \"pronounciation.\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/quick-welsh-lesion.html"},{"title":"Reflections on an enormous puddle","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    25 Jul 2007        \n        \n\nYou ignored all the warnings\nAbout global warming\n(Or climate change as we now call it)\nYou dismissed the statistics\nAs myth told by mystics\nIn favour of cramming your wallit.\nAll those air miles behind you\nExpanding your mind?

Even now she had to admit to the memory of her mum, who sat judging her in her head, that she'd never made a cup that hadn't tasted a bit funny.\nPerhaps, she had once reasoned, if she used the fancy tea that was meant to taste of smoke, then its flavour would mask whatever it was that she managed to do with it. But that hadn't worked: it had started tasting like the milk was off instead. Cheaters never prosper, she had concluded—that was her mother again, or the shadow she cast—and switched to jars of instant tea, that she kept on the counter so as to be scrupulously honest. The openness paid off, as her tea finally tasted merely as bad as expected.\nSuch a lack of skill, however cheerily presented, soon palls and eventually irritates. It certainly didn't help when she had to start cooking whole dinners for a whole family. Every extra stage in the complex process of a meal was an opportunity to under- or over-cook; to under- or over-spice; to blacken, curdle or otherwise ruin a key ingredient.\nOver a lifetime it had been possible for her to perfect just the one meal, and that was enough. Ideal, really: these were the days before Delia Smith; her formative ones were, anyway, with Homepride sauces a revolution still over the culinary horizon. Every night for the first year, the measured together (with affection) how long the vegetables had taken, or how much butter had been added to how many potatoes—of what variety—before being mashed for how long. Each chop was weighed and then cooked according to variations on the recommended timescale. Every meal was summarized at the end in notes, with asterisks for exceptional results. At the end of this tortuous process, and then for decades afterwards, she was able to cook a version of meat, two greens and mash that—however unexciting—was perfectly, perfectedly edible. With a pudding from the fridge, that was unwrapped immediately before eating.\nBut now, after all those years, it was like she had lost the recipe, and every meal was wrong again. As she straightened from leaning over the colander and wiped a little steam off her glasses, she paused to wonder what might be the problem. Not for long, though: falling foul of her own timetable would hardly help the dinner turn out well this time. She moved onto the potatoes, then checked the pork, which sizzled at just the right volume. So what could be the problem?\nIt was only when the food was assembled on the plates, and the plates on the table, that she realized once again what was wrong and why. She sat down and picked up a serving spoon, and looked round from dish to dish. Everything was on her half of the table: the potatoes (25 min), carrots (20 min), peas (5 min, with mint), chops (18-25 min) and gravy (2 min; Oxo, of course); both serving spoons and even the salt and pepper. Nothing was so far away that she would have to ask for it, but of everything there was twice too much.\nShe stared without seeing for some minutes, as all the food cooled down. Then she bit her lip and stood up again, the scrape of her chair echoing around the room. She took each dish in turn and carried it over to the bin. Then, carefully, she pushed exactly just over half of the dish's contents into the black bag with a serving spoon, and returned what was left to the table. The gravy she poured down the sink: just over half of it, as with everything else.\nShe sat back down and looked ahead, over the half-empty plates on a half-empty table, at a completely empty chair. She made a mental note to change the recipe that they'd both used for years. She'd cross out all the numbers and write new ones in their place. Tomorrow.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/relying-tradition.html"},{"title":"Seek him in the valley","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    20 Sep 2001        \n        \n\nA scrabble of feet, a rattle of stones that spill down the path like bleached old bones. More care was needed. With the spine of the hills behind him, the downward journey began with the steepest slopes yet, and the road surface had long since dissolved into a mess of aggregate. \n Ahead of him stretched a valley painted in the colours of sweet peppers. Groves of orange trees were stitched with precision into the ground beneath him amongst fields of crops he did not recognise. Gently-sloping hills cupped the plain, save for a few gaps for the autopista and the railway. By leaving the main road he had shaved perhaps hours of walking off his journey; these were the hours that he himself had added by leaving the bus and his paranoias behind. Off to his left he could see perhaps where his dirt track shuffled ashamedly up to the autopista. Could he also see, through a few rare, tall trees, Paio's house, soaking up the sun and bestowing whiteness on the landscape? He thought so. He hoped so. Convinced himself of it. Carried on, scattering pebbles. \nHe was thirstier and more tired; the pains in his feet grew steadily stronger. It didn't seem that long ago that he had been in London, where the summer heat had broken for a few days into a cool deluge. The streets' dust had been cleaned away, and fumes soaked up into the rain. The memory of it, as he picked his way towards the valley, annoyed him with its coolness. Why had he come all this way? Why did he let himself become embroiled in plans that he had long ago ceased to have any real interest in? Mr Barnaby asked himself this, and could return no answer. \n From behind came the skid and clatter of rocks. Mr Barnaby knew in a moment that he had failed, that his pursuer had left the bus too, and had followed him without detection here. Only now, when Mr Barnaby could not run, certainly not as far as the villa, had his sinister shadow picked itself up and abandoned care and secrecy, knowing that Mr Barnaby was in its power. \n With slapped, heavy steps he turned resignedly, to be confronted by a muscly old man, not his expected company at all. The man was unshaven and, from his rubbery frame, may have been as much monkey as he was presumably human. When he opened his mouth to speak it was clear from the black holes that his chewing days were now only ever thought of at mealtimes, fondly. \n \"Señor Barnaby?\" His voice was gravelly, but his gums slopped and lisped around the edges of the words. Mr Barnaby could only nod. Had this man, this ape, been sent to intercept him and his message? He cursed himself for leaving the envelope in his back pocket, an obvious white flag. With an effort he stopped himself reaching for it, the impulse to hide it strong. \n Strong. Despite his age, the man who faced him was clearly strong, wirily strong. He was probably accustomed to the heat too. Would he try to overpower Mr Barnaby? The younger man tried to tense his complaining muscles, but the old man began to speak. \n \"Is good to see you OK,\" he spat. \"Señor Paio fear for you. Word from London is someone following. Then autobus turn up and -\" he spread his hands wide, \"you not on it! But now you're here!\" By these words, the old man had come quite close to Mr Barnaby, gesturing up to his face. He laughed roughly and slapped Mr Barnaby on the arm. \"Ha ha! OK, señor, let us go. Follow me!\" and then, with a rolling sailor's gait, he struck out towards the villa. Bemusedly, Mr Barnaby followed.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/seek-him-valley.html"},{"title":"Sense of place","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    13 Mar 2008        \n        \n\nHe started the car engine, then almost immediately stopped it. He still needed to calm down. Even the best visits to see Mother were bad for his nerves, but this time had been awful. There was never any talking to her on certain subjects. For a start, she'd never liked Angie—had once called her (not to her face) a scrawny little bitch, all ribs and teeth—and had only grudgingly blessed their union when she had realised she risked losing her beloved son for good. So he could hardly discuss what had been happening at home. And Mother had never acknowledged how much Father used to knock them all—Mother included—about the house as though they were dice rattling in a cup. There was no shared ground there, for loving reminiscences about the days before the old bugger popped his clogs. But today it had been clear from the start that, despite the dangers hiding behind every other possible topic of conversation, explaining to Mother why they needed to sell the house she had lived in for sixty years was not the comparatively easy option.\nHe could still picture her now. She had planted herself into the carpet, with the heavy, bulbous writing-desk on her right, drawers and board locked and snapped together, and the dresser looming over her left shoulder, a faded dinner set exhibited on it behind a lattice of vertical dowels, and a collection of family photographs beneath. She was occupying a position of power, an intersection of domestic ley lines, and it looked like there was no budging her this side of doomsday.\nHe had tried to reason with her. That was a mistake: the house wasn't about reason; it was about family. He wouldn't be suggesting she move out, he explained, if it weren't absolutely necessary. He knew how much she loved the place, but—and he never finished the sentence. \"You've no idea how I feel about this place,\" she countered, and then she was off. Dad this, Grandad that, his sister and two brothers the other. Spending a honeymoon decorating the front room. All of the children born in the master bedroom upstairs; all of them growing up; all of them leaving; poor Graham, the eldest, lost at Goose Green.\nWell, of course, he said, he loved it too. He tried to crack wise, recalled cracking his head on the stone lintel at the bottom of the stairs. He would miss the old place too. \"You say it,\" she replied, \"but you don't mean it. You don't feel it in your bones like I do.\" And there was never any arguing with her bones. Some families were governed by the matriarch's moles, but his was built around his mother's thin frame. It was supported by her compactness and springiness; it spread and moved from place to place at her articulation alone—whenever it reluctantly did so then she complained her joints ached; and Graham and Father would always be her phantom limbs, limbs that nonetheless could easily, magically, take the whole weight of her whole argument if the occasion demanded.\nIt was then that it occurred to him: what about her bones? First he told her he was sorry, that he didn't want to upset her. He only had her best interests in mind: \"aye, and me money,\" she interjected, but he carried on apologising all the same. It's her house and he shouldn't have raised the idea of her selling it like that.\nBut what would happen, he asked after half a beat, if she became sick? What would happen if she fell? Who would help her if she was in this house all alone? And as she started to reply, saying that she could ring either him or his sister and they'd come over, he asked her how she would reach the telephone from the bathroom with a broken hip. There was no reply to that, of course (not even the obvious negative) that didn't admit she was old. And that was out of the question.\nAs he was saying all this she had taken one hesitating step backward and put her hand on the dresser to steady herself. He stood up and moved towards her, explaining that it was best for her, never mind the rest of them, if she would just live somewhere with people to look after her all the time. \"You're going to put me in a home,\" she said, matter-of-factly. Then she repeated it, but in a wail that ended with her breaking into tears. \"Only,\" she cried, and then wept a little more.\nHe stood up at this, and walked over to hug her. He hadn't hugged her, not properly, for years, but thought he would try it out. She was so small, and seemed to be made entirely out of shoulderblades and elbows. \"Only,\" she said again, muffled in his embrace, \"only I'm already in me home. I don't need to go anywhere else.\"\nHe told her they could talk about it another time. He said she shouldn't worry too much till then (knowing she would), and just make sure instead that she was making the right decision either way (knowing she would). He said that he and Charlie and Ellie would be there for her, whatever she decided. He even called her Mum. And when he stopped hugging her then he himself was standing with the dresser to his left and the writing-desk to his right. Two minutes later he was out of the door and another thirty seconds later he was round the corner and sat in the car.\nBoth hands on the steering-wheel, he now smiled grimly to himself. She was a hard woman, his mother. She almost never cried; the last time he remembered her doing so was at Father's funeral. So when he saw the first few tears... that was when he had known for certain: he had won. She would sell, although it might take her a long time to decide. She would move out. Satisfied, he started the engine again, and gently—so gently that it seemed almost loving—he pulled the car out and moved away.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/sense-place.html"},{"title":"She watched television","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    17 Apr 2001        \n        \n\nThe kettle began to react, trembling a little, and then the water was boiling, wisps of steam padding out to become clouds and then a mist, which condensed onto the shelf of spices, opened and spilled and tired. Packets of biscuits, cereal, a few tins and caddies: they kept a respectful distance of worktop from the kettle, cowering like primitives before fire. The switch clicked off by magic as a figure in jeans reached the kitchen. She found a cup, closed a cupboard door, shook out some dead coffee into the cup, poured water onto it and stirred.\nShe brushed black hair away from sharp, Roman features, absorbed in making the drink, and started as the telephone began to ring a shrill bird call. Picking up the cup, she tripped out of the room into the hall, leaving the kettle to sigh and relax, and the condiments to shuffle a little closer in sympathy.\nThe living room faced south, and was bright and sunny. A blue felt sofa half-covered with the Independent was opposite a television, and a coffee table nestled into a thick-pile rug. The contents of a bookcase against one wall were sparse, and an occasional table with a green glass top carried a small lamp and the telephone. The telephone handset was singing brightly and loudly as she entered the room - barefooted on bare floorboards - and picked it up as she sat down on the sofa. The talk button was squashy to the touch. Ssh.\n\n\tHi. [slow, broadening smile]\n\tHi, you.\n\tYeah, just making a drink.\n\tShe called a few minutes ago. Something came up. At work.\n\tAh, I'll just watch TV. Chill [stretch, and sit back]. You?\n\tPoor you. I'll send pizza round.\n\t[grin, then laugh] OK, I'll get them to send a salad.\n\tYeah.\n\tI think so, yeah. I mean, Jan' might want to go out some other time, but I can keep tomorrow night free.\n\tThat'd be great. Anywhere special?\n\tYeah. I'd like that. Okay. See you then.\n\tBye. [bip] \nThe phone was returned, more or less, to its cradle, and a green LED switched on as it homed in on the electrodes and slept. She reached for the television remote, an almost identical machine, felt the brushed plastic in her hand, sandstone that would not yield, and pressed randomly. The television made a melodramatic whirring hum for a half second, and warmed up to play the voice of someone inconsequential on the local BBC news, closely followed by a smooth, focussed picture. It was perfect, balanced colour, and somehow more real than the rest of the room, a painting of a disaster surrounded by the mundane.\nShe watched television. Outside, the sun set. Street lights came on. She didn't remember turning on the table lamp. Programmes came and went. The phone didn't ring again, but she wasn't expecting it to.\nLong black lashes crept over moist eyes. She was staring at the television screen but showed no recognition of what was on. Her skin rumpled where her hand propped her head up at no small angle. The light of the television threw broad sweeps of colour onto her face. A cushion was in her lap, protecting her from stomach cramps, and her legs were tucked up under her.\nThe coffee cup sat on the table in front of her, long since cooled and sticky with three or four drops of liquid. Her eyes blinked slowly three times, then closed. Her head nodded forward; she pulled it backwards and took a deep breath, lips not wanting to part. She reached for the remote control, took it in a warm, sleep-fuzzy hand and switched off the television. She unfolded her legs to the floor, switched off the light. In the drips and splashes of street light, she fumbled her way to the door, closing it behind her.\ninspired by PJ Harvey's \"Beautiful Feeling\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/she-watched-television.html"},{"title":"At the side","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    22 Aug 2004        \n        \n\n\"Not bloody bored now, are you, John Atherton?\"\nJohn sweated into his collar, his kex, the shovel handle and the mud of Charlie Waterworth's grave. In time John's brow would do its bit to rot Charlie's posh wood casket: John's brow and the still pricking rain. Sweat met the drizzle and mixed. The hole was three feet deep, but it should've been five by now; the Waterworths would have to make room for the two diggers during the burial at this rate. John looked round at the four walls, at Bert perched owlishly at the side, and Bert's pipe, held pointing at the sky. Just the sight of the mud around him sapped the strength from John's arms and he tried to get his breath back, looking all the time at Bert.\n\"Yes.\"\nBert frowned. \"Ah, bugger you,\" he said and got back to his pipe. He puffed at it, with a beat that he seemed to want John to follow with his digging. He looked at John, who started work again. Slowly he dug. He stressed each pull of the shovel, stretched it out till it was like an actor digging. Every move he tried to put between two sucks of Bert's pipe. Out of the corner of his eye John looked for a reaction.\nFinally Bert ground his teeth on the stem and said: \"Can't you go any bloody faster, John Atherton?\"\n\"Can't you give us hand, y'old sod?\" John was having trouble with the soil. It had clumped itself onto the shovel as far as the where the wood handle began. He shook the shovel, then swung it round so he could reach the other end. \"This'd never take so bloody long if you were in 'ere as well.\" He pulled a clod off the edge of the blade. It crumbled in his hands, leaving two small bones.\n\"Ugh! Agh! Bloody hell!\" he cried, appalled; he dropped them and tried to climb backwards up the side of the grave.\n\"What's wrong wi you now, you bugger?\" Bert asked angrily.\n\"Bones! Bloody bones!\" John was sat on the grass now, legs still hanging over the hole, but tensed up so they didn't dangle down against the sides. John changed his mind again and stood up, far away from the grave.\nBert looked down into it. He chewed on his gums a bit. This was an old church. Some graves might have lost their stones over the years. They might have been digging one up all this time. If there were a body already in there then they'd have to stop on this hole and dig another somewhere else. There just wasn't time for that. He spied the white fragments that John had dug up, and suddenly he laughed a whip-crack that echoed off the surrounding hills.\n\"A mole! Frightened by bones of a mole! Daft bugger. Get back into t'ole, go on. Learn yirself a thing or two from t'mole.\"\n\"I'm not going back in there. There might be summat else.\"\n\"Frightened, are ye?\"\n\"Aye.\"\n\"Bloody kids,\" said Bert, meaning just the one. \"Wish I'd never bloody gone ter wake ye. Right.\" And he bent himself one bit of limb at a time into the hole, slowly, to try and make John feel a bit of guilt. When John had said nothing and Bert was in the grave, Bert called up: \"Well?\"\n\"Well what?\"\nBert said, holding his arms out as if to point himself out to John. \"I'm in.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"So, come down an' all.\"\n\"Bugger that!\"\n\"Blimey, ye're a moody bugger.\"\n\"Yeah? So're you.\"\n\"I'm old and knackered. What excuse do you 'ave for it, eh?\"\nJohn tried to think of one. He looked round, and both their tempers cooled. Trying in vain to fan the flames, Bert repeated: \"Eh?\" But John couldn't think of an answer, and he looked so miserable stood up there covered in mud, rain like tears on his cheeks, a child's face, that Bert felt sorry for him.\n\"I'm young and fed up!\"\n\"Fed up? What, wi' diggin'?\" Confused, Bert picked up the shovel and bent to work.\n\"No, not that. Just... nowt ever happens.\" It was more complicated, but John could never get further than that.\n\"What about t'mole? That was summat, wasn' it?\"\nJohn rolled his eyes. \"I don' want bloody mole bones!\" he shouted. \"What's t'bloody point of a bloody mole? I want summat interestin' to 'appen. I'm fed up of this 'ole bloody place. Sooner I get outer 'ere the better.\"\nJohn paused and was quiet. They both heard the sound of footsteps down by the church. They looked at each other and then craned their necks towards the noise. The Waterworths had started to arrive. Early.\n\"Oh, bloody hell,\" they both said, and then Bert: \"Come on, John. We must 'ave an hour at most.\" John nodded, picked up a second shovel, and jumped into the grave, and they both hacked away at the ground. Faster they hewed, chopping as if their lives were at stake. Bert stuck his head up once and saw the vicar looking over at them, a frown on his face that meant excommunication. \"Oh, bloody hell,\" he said again, bent over, whacked the shovel into the ground and pulled hard on the handle.\n\"Agh, me back!\" Bert shouted and staggered backwards. His face was cringed with pain. \"Oh, Jesus, John, me back's gone.\" He breathed hard a few times and tried to steady himself, still in the same position. John didn't know what to say. Bert had back trouble sometimes; he used it to excuse never picking anything heavy up. But this weren't a time for skiving, so Bert must mean it. \"What're we gonner do now?\" the old man cried out.\nJohn looked at him for a few seconds. \"Right,\" he decided and, dropping his own shovel, scrambled out of the grave.\n\"What? What's goin' on? John! Don' leave me in 'ere!\"\n\"I'm gettin' that bloody thing started.\"\nBert looked like he hadn't heard. Then his mouth swung open with shock. Stiff with pain from his chest to his hips, he made a few tries at getting out of the grave before he was stood, bent as usual, and began to waddle after John.\n\"Ye don't know how to bloody drive!\" he called at John's back.\nJohn flapped a hand back at Bert \"Can't be that 'ard,\" he said. \"How fast can it go? It's only a bloody digger.\"\nJohn got to the cab and pulled himself into the seat. Bert had left the keys in, and they swung with the shock of John's sitting down. He turned them and there was a noise like half a pull of a saw on wood. He turned them again, and again there was the noise. He pulled out a knob marked \"CHOKE\" and fiddled with a stick that must have been the gears. He turned the keys, messed with something, turned the keys, another couple of sticks, but they were probably for the digger arm, turned the keys, turned the keys.... Nothing.\n\"Look,\" Bert said, \"best leave it, eh? I couldn't get it to bloody start this morning, an' I were at it for a good hour an' alf. We don't have time for this, John Atherton. Get out of that bloody machine and give us 'and with diggin'-\"\nJohn turned the keys again: nothing. \"John! Come on!\" Pissed off at Bert and the digger both, he kicked out at the metal plates between him and the engine. It all roared to life. Left in gear by Bert, and then put into and out of gear a few times by John, before being left in gear again, the digger took off and pitched itself over a few ruts before pointing itself towards the church.\nJohn struggled to turn left or right, but nothing seemed to work. The lumber and plod of the digger quickly put enough space between him and Bert that he couldn't hear any of his advice, couldn't hear it anyway over the banging of the engine; he realized that, like it or not, this was the most exciting thing that had happened to him in years. As the friends and family of the dearly departed Charlie Waterworth scattered from the path to the church—a path that the digger was bent on taking—he thought briefly about all the things that had ever happened in the village. None of them would compare to this. And, watching the huge arm of the runaway beast struck the church door, and finding time had slowed down, as splinters flew this way and that way to the tune of a crashing, grinding racket of a noise, John decided that he would never, ever, complain again that nothing ever happened.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/side.html"},{"title":"Slash dev slash null","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    19 May 2010        \n        \n\ncampinmygarden.com has been taken by domain squatters.\nIf all the people in the world squatted on your A record\nWould you tell Tim Berners Lee or would you give in to the squat-horde?\nI can see that all the possibilities of evil\nCould sway your first decision: subject them all to slash-dev-slash-null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash null\nAnd do you feel your site is threatened by the fabricated entries\nSent in by the sons of spammers you blocked back in the noughties?\nI can see that all the moderation-queue upheaval could\nJust back up your decision: subject them all to slash-dev-slash-null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash null\nI can't stand another Viagra bot\nI'll just let the buggers squat\nWhen all the people in the world give up on your A record\nWould you celebrate the passing of your life as Mister Squat-Lord?\nYou could see your internetly fame has come full circle\nJust open up a terminal; subject your site to slash-dev-slash-null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash null\nI can't stand another Viagra bot\nI meant to disable this but forgot\nI can't stand another Viagra bot\nI'll just let the buggers squat\nOh goodness, my gracious; domain-squatting's contagious\nMy site now links to hentai and it's been like that for ages\nOh goodness, my gracious; domain-squatting's contagious\nThere's goatse and there's lemon-party on all of the pages, ba-doo-\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash-null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash-null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop) slash-dev-slash-null\n(wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop, bop-ba doo-wop)\nSlash-dev-slash-null\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/slash-dev-slash-null.html"},{"title":"In the snow","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    22 Oct 2003        \n        \n\nI don't know if it was my fault or not.

Meeting John was a bit like extreme sports for the head and heart. It was like the ground disappeared underneath my feet, and my heart began walloping away in my chest like a drummer convention.\nPoor John. Blame his parents, of course. Who would call their child John Wayne Leventhal? Jay Dubya, John, Jay Wayne to his university friends. A running joke I only partly understand, that surfaces every now and again with someone (usually drunk) hollering at him: \"Hey, Wayne!\" I can't say I find it funny. It reeks of twenty-four packs of cheap beer and parties in bedsits and smoking dope at 2am. Although John was a rower (he still has the tone and muscle) so perhaps there was no dope, just lots more beer. Every time he heard the holler he'd grin, and although I often saw fatigue in that grin I'm sure he never let on to his friends. If he was in an especially good mood he'd drawl out the response \"That's Jay Wayne!\"\nHis friends all accepted me - us - with surprisingly good grace, considering.\nI can't say I ever got on with any of them. They were loose ties to his old, carefree life, and I found that threatening: to us, as a couple. After John's graduation he found a job quickly, which was what I wanted. We weren't thinking of setting up home together any time soon or anything. I just liked it that he was settling down. I'd never gone to uni' and couldn't see the attraction of student life. John - Wayne, I suppose - had spent three years in that limbo of no responsibility and no security, and now that he had nothing better to do Wayne sat on John's shoulder, prompting him every now and then. When John planned a drinking session for our six-month anniversary, not neglectful but forgetful, that was Wayne whispering in his ear and telling him to do that. Mostly, though, John has left Wayne behind and I'm very glad. Wayne and Mel are sat around in 2001 and it's like I can see them out of the back of a car as we drive away and they recede, getting smaller, their accusing looks fading into petulance.\nI suppose I did steal him from Mel. But she was Mel He Wasn't Happy With, Mel Who Is Hard Work, Mel The Psycho Bitch.... all those native American names for her, the shorthand everyone used when talking about John and not to John. So I forgot what a bad thing it was. But, you see, you turn a corner and you're heading downstream, and you have to forget and think about the next bend. Mel was always around lots of bends, all at once. You had no idea what she would do next.\nIt was all going great on the snowy December Saturday. John had said he had finally convinced his parents that I wasn't some sort of hussy or heart-breaker (I know the words they really used about me, even though John wouldn't tell me, and \"hussy\" and \"hearbreaker\" are compliments in comparison, trust me). We were to spend Christmas at their house. Last Christmas we spent apart, and it had been rotten. Compared to previous Christmases alone it had been like someone had taken all the tinsel down. But his parents had realised John and I were each other's for keeps, and were going to write to me to invite me down to stay. That's how old-fashioned they were: invitations by post and RSVP. I imagined that the invite would be a piece of crimp-cut card, embossed with information about what we would be expected to wear on Christmas day. I was scared stiff but so happy. John suggested we go out to the park, fool around in the snow and look over at the city, made pretty by the white icing. \"A chance to see the centre not looking like a pile of crap,\" he said. \"How can you refuse?\" I couldn't ever refuse.\nWe climbed up the hill together, holding hands. I thought briefly that we should've been pulling a sled behind us, to complete the scene. At the top we looked out at the view. It may have been office blocks and concrete carbuncles but John was right, it was beautiful. Greetings-card perfect in this weather. We got our breath back, and I listened to the silence, not even a bird, a few other walkers far below muffled by the snow-\nA snowball hit me on the shoulder. John sniggered and ran a few more yards distant. I stared open-mouthed for a few seconds, then reached down for some snow. As soon as he saw this he started doing the same, but I got there first, and a powdery splat turned his hair salt-and-pepper, like an old man. Making threatening noises he started running towards me with another snowball, and I backed away. When we were close enough to touch he shoved the snow down my collar and I shouted and ran off.\nTen minutes later we were still fooling around. We'd both hit each other several times, and had blobs of compacted snow stuck to our jackets like exploded paintballs. I hid behind a tree and started piling snow on snow, as if I were beginning to make a snowman. I rolled the lump around a bit to pick up even more snow, and by now it was almost as big as a basketball. With a whoop I lifted it over my head and started towards John. When I thought I was close enough, and early enough that he still looked surprised and wasn't going to react in time, I threw it at his head, two-handed and with all my strength.\nJohn ducked and the monster floated lazily over his shoulder and down the brow of the hill. Carl was running up to meet us, his fat legs sweating and pumping, and instead met a lump of snow the size of his head, hitting him square in the chest. The impact bowled him over backwards in a fluff of snow dust and escaping breath. He landed on his rear and almost before he struck the floor we were running down to meet him, full of apologies. Especially me. It had to be me that had floored one of John's old friends.\n\"Jesus... Fucking... Christ. Wayne, why don't you have your... mobile switched on...? I've been trying to ring you for two hours.\" With the last couple of words his voice became strained and falsetto with the suppressed desire to breathe in again. Then he did, pulling air in and pushing it out. God knows how he found us. He must have run all the way from his house, somewhere down there towards the city, lost now in the snow.\nJohn fumbled for the phone in his kagool pocket. One of my snowballs - despite my characteristic non-aim - had smacked onto its open zipper. The phone was sprinkled with snow, and had hurriedly powered itself down at the first hint of moisture. It played possum, hoping to wake up somewhere drier.\n\"It's switched itself off, Carl. What's the problem?\"\n\"It's Mel.\"\nJohn didn't want me to come to the hospital with him in the first place. I don't blame him, but I worry. It wasn't as though he weighed up all the facts and knew that he had to leave me behind, that no good could come of Mel seeing me in her state (and my state, come to that). No. It was his instinctive reaction, to push me away from him and the whole situation. Maybe he was doing it for my own good, protecting me from the explosion, shoulder-barging me from under the wheels of the car bearing down on him.... But after two days, and after John said that she was stable - well, sort of - I wanted to see her. I don't know what my plan was. I still wasn't planning. We weren't out of dangerous currents and half-exposed rocks yet, and I was still making decisions as they came to me. I wanted to see her. Understand. Connect. Empathise. Repair. Make whole again.\nAll she could do was cry. She sat there in the hospital bed, listening to me stumble out a few shitty phrases. and cried silently. Her eyes wept: now on their own, now accompanied by her shuddering shoulders. She shook her head at me, incredulously, as if to say \"the gall, the chutzpah, the nerve.\" Then she said what I was desperately hoping she wouldn't say.\n\"Don't you understand? Can't you see it? It's your fault. It's all your fault. You took him away from me.\"\nAnd then:\n\"You've ruined my life. You've, you've ruined everything. You've no idea how it feels. You don't know wh-what it's like, to be passed over f-for a man.\"\nNot saying anything else, I got up and walked. Out of her room (the nurses looked at me, expressionless) and through the ward to the corridors. Off the tiled floors, onto brown carpet, and reaching the lift. I pressed the button and waited, holding the top of my head with my hands. What could I have told her? That I knew exactly how it felt? The lift arrived with the sound of a quavering, synthesised bell, and the doors clumped open. I stepped inside and pressed \"G\", closing the doors and setting the lift off on its journey. Should I have hit back, as gently as possible, fought what I heard in her voice - not hating me, but people like me? The lift stopped and tipped me out. I walked past corridors, drinks machines, and the reception desk, and the automatic front doors slid aside at the last minute to let me leave. I'd been dumped for all sorts; plenty of them had been bastards and bitches and I knew about it and couldn't do anything. But in the end the eddies and the whorls had just been kind to me. They'd kept me away from the rocks on which Mel had foundered.\nOutside it was snowing again. I walked into the quiet, the black and the white. I kept walking, away from the hospital towards town, waiting for the falling snow to wash me clean, to wash me clean away.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/snow.html"},{"title":"Social Event","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    8 Sep 2003        \n        \n\nI don't like parties. Well, I tell people that, don't I, because they don't understand otherwise. I like my own parties more, but I don't tell people that for the same reason. Better off sober at parties, really, because then I make fewer mistakes. I don't think I'm autistic or anything, but complicated social things pass me by. When I first heard about that quantum stuff, with one thing affecting another thing when they're miles apart, but you can't even look at what's passing between them because that spoils the effect... I mean, that made so much sense: it was like the look across a crowded room, or the joke that everyone laughs at even though it's crapper than the ones I'd just been telling. I say it made sense, but it only ever made sense when I was already half pissed. Then it felt like there were undercurrents everywhere. I could really believe in them, running between everyone and pulling them around. But they were still just about out of reach. Eventually I realized that being drunk wasn't helping me grasp what I couldn't at the best of times, so just stayed a bit tipsy, not sober but civil at any rate.\nAnyway, this was my own party---well, mine and Adam's and Peter's, in the new house that I'd got the buggers to tidy up for the occasion---so I'd only had a few. Every now and then I snarfed a Red Bull, just to keep myself awake. I mixed vodka with some of them, Helen always calls that a \"VRB\", but I didn't want to get too pissed and not be in a position to stop people smashing plates or pouring red wine all over the carpet. Especially that bloody beige stuff in the hall---or is it wheat or some other crap? What's the point of that stuff in a rented house, anyway? I mean, for Christ's sake. Sorry.\nThe party had been going pretty well by midnight and didn't look like it was going to stop any time soon. We'd had a couple of gatecrashers, actually. I was worried when I first saw them, as they were quite big blokes, but they spoke like someone's parents and they were so bloody nice. They both brought a bottle of pretty expensive-looking wine, Tio something or other. I don't know wine from wee-wee but I this stuff tasted gorgeous. I suppose between them they drank far more than they had on them, but they were such good fun that I didn't really want to say anything. They really livened up the party. Even Miserable Ed didn't sit in the bloody corner again, although I wouldn't say he was exactly life and soul.\nRalph was OK. Quite a good laugh until he started on the Bacardi, then that cheap tequila, and then I think he had a whole bottle of bloody Bailey's to himself---a glass of it's pretty gay but a whole bottle is just fecking mental. I lost track of him a bit because he went upstairs to talk to the stoners, and then next thing I knew he was passed out on the sofa. He was a doctor, so he told everyone; \"physician\" was what he actually said, which struck me as a bit posh. And pronouncing his name \"Rayf\". I mean. Mind you, I think it was Mike that introduced him, but it's still a bit stuck up. Like that film star all the girls in the office like. They don't swoon over him, I mean not like the one who played D'Arcy in Bridget Jones or anything, but I once made the mistake of mentioning that film he's in, The English Patient (pile of crap, if you ask me) and they all went off on one for ages.\nAnyway, I was talking about Mike, and that night he had been talking to everyone, anyone who listened (so everyone in reach, really). He really made sense to me, you know? Not in a poofy way. But having him round the place.... It's like, oh, what's it like? When you put a tin tray on the radio aerial, and suddenly you can hear Chris Moyles or someone clear as a bell, cracked fucking bell, but yeah. I got the whole conversation so much more with Mike around, like he knew how to lead it and keep everyone interested. I'm not normally that quick on the uptake---I mean, I think that's sometimes a good thing, sometimes you have to be slow and steady, don't you?---but I sort of heard more of everything that night.\nAnd God, he was funny! I mean, Ralph had been a laugh like I say, but he was a bit showy and, well, odd, really. Mike was like he'd been going to parties all his life, although he said he didn't get out that much. I got the impression they both worked somewhere pretty antisocial. Although if they weren't partiers then they were bloody hard drinkers. Mike was getting through his third bottle of wine when he got off a good one about Steve and his extreme sports hobbies. \"I don't suppose you go for that sort of thing, do you?\" said Steve, in that way of his that means \"you're clearly not as brave as me, but I don't mind talking to you\". Cunt. But Mike just said \"Oh, yeah, I do.\" He shook his glass. \"Extreme drinking.\" And everyone fell about laughing.\nThere was one weird thing that night, though. Well, three, I suppose, but this was the first. He was banging on about religion a bit, but it was all old stuff. And he mentioned something like those angels, seraphim, but it wasn't seraphim. Sepharim? No, that wasn't it either. Some Old Testament stuff, Jehovah this and Jehovah that, but he didn't say \"Jehovah\", I don't think. Someone asked him if he was Christian, a bit like asking if you're gay with our lot. He stumbled a bit, and said \"errm\", only it wasn't that. It was a bit drawn out and, like, tortured: \"Eheiehhhh....\" He turned it into an impression, who was it of? That Emlyn Hughes guy. Shiv noticed it because he was the oldest person there, and actually remembered \"A Question Of Sport.\" He laughed like a drain at it too, because it was the end of Eid and so he was completely off his face.  Mike smiled at that, like he was humouring Shiv, but he saw sense and changed the subject. It was quite funny for a while, actually. He went on about the Devil a lot. I think he was overcompensating, didn't want people to think he was an evi, did he, but it was good stuff. There was a joke about George Bush selling his soul for peanuts that he told, and I wish I could tell it like he did but I can't. So I won't.\nOne of the stoners from upstairs, Jess, I think (glassy eyes and skinny legs, well, normally she's got normal eyes but that night she was pretty wankered) was laughing for a few minutes at that Bush gag. Then she stopped for a while, then started giggling again. Mike was taking her in like he'd never seen anything like her before. I don't think he fancied her. It was like he was looking at her under a microscope or something. Taking mental notes. Made me feel a bit chilly, actually. I didn't want to think I'd let a psycho into the house, did I? I looked round for the cutlery drawer and put myself casually between Mike and it.... I probably was a bit pissed, actually.\n\"You're funny, Mike. You and your mate. It's a shame he, er, peaked so soon, like? Eh?\" And then another wave of giggles like bubbles from a can of Coke. This made me want another RB, this time with a lot of vodka in it, so I started pouring one out with one ear as it were cocked towards the conversation.\n\"Yeah, well, he's one for the drink is Ralph. He doesn't drink much at home—I mean, generally—but when he does, he's a bit of a demon for it. The demon drink, isn't it?\"\nJess stared for a few seconds, and then it was as if this had been the most hysterical thing he'd said all night. She laughed and laughed. I think she might have wet herself if another one of our resident dope fiends hadn't got into the act. \"He was so fucken cool, though, right? That stuff he was doing. Magic like stuff, and all that.\"\n\"What?\" said Mike. It felt like someone had turned the heating and the music down, both at once.\n\"You know, sleight of hand stuff,\" he said, holding his fat hands up and rubbing his fingers against each other like chafing legs. \"He made a coin appear from up my nose. Then a rabbit from a hat. I mean,\" he turned to everyone else now, \"an actual rabbit, from Jess's actual hat! I swear I saw a rabbit, but then he threw it up at the ceiling and it was like it just---pfff. Gone. Fucking class, that, Mike. I don't know how he fucken did it.\"\nThen the second bit of weirdness. Mike rolled his eyes at this, trying to pass off whatever it was he was about to do as being nothing much, but you could see Ralph had done something wrong. Like something out of turn, or something. It made me think: maybe Mike was a bit of an evi after all. Is it Baptists or Methodists that are really down on gambling and cards and stuff? When I was a kid, one of our neighbours used to be like that. He once saw me with a pack of cards playing snap and he played hell.\n\"Excuse me, guys,\" he said, still as polite as ever, but clearly a bit fucked off. He walked over to where Ralph was sprawled and bent down to his ear.\n\"Ralph,\" he whispered. \"Ralph. Ralph, mate. Ralph!\" he screamed, but all that happened was Ralph's eyes flicked open. They were bloodshot and focussed on nothing. The whole room must've been spinning. A whole bottle of Bailey's. I shake my head when I think of it. \"Gnwa,\" he began. He couldn't get his mouth to move properly at first, and smacked his lips a bit. \"Gal. Galab?  Harab. Gamal-\"\nAt this point Mike cuffed him round the head. That doesn't sound much but I could hear the impact from the kitchen as if it was right by my ear, not Ralph's, and the poor bugger clearly felt it. He looked, if anything, more stunned than before he was hit, although his eyes began to clear pretty soon after that.\n\"Come on, Ralph,\" said Mike. \"We're going.\"\nAs Ralph struggled to get out of our couch---it's had me like that a few times since, especially when I've been a bit pissed, and that time I slept on it---Mike said to us: \"I forgot, we've got to get up early tomorrow, I'm afraid. Bit of a pain, really. Work\"\n\"On a Sunday?\"\n\"Yeah, well, no rest for the wicked, I'm afraid. It's been a great party,\" he said to me. \"Thanks for letting us trespass, you know, gatecrash. Hopefully see you again.\"\nRalph bowed, almost touching his toes. \"You've been a lovely host,\" he said, \"and I only wish I could say the same for us, sir.\" Sir? The last time someone called me sir it was a bloke at the train station trying to be smart and actually being a cunt. I don't think Ralph meant anything by it. The sincerity of the drunk, I suppose. Anyway, they both left sharpish, not putting on any coats---I don't think they came with any anyway---and closed the door after them. It swung back open a little, though, and I was going to follow them anyway to ask them where they lived. I mean, they were a good laugh, weren't they? They'd been nice guests. It'd've been good to have them round some time, or go to the pub with them. I don't know if they'd've found me much fun, mind you, but what the hell, I thought... so I followed them out.\nThe house is just on the junction of Hodson Crescent and Cadmon Street, and they'd got as far as the lampost on the corner. They were arguing and I didn't think it would be a good idea to make an appearance just yet. I hid in our garden behind the shitty dead privet and saw them now and again between the branches. I could hear Mike give Raff a whack round the head again, harder this time, but he laughed like he barely felt it and just grinned. Then Mike said:\n\"Bollocks, Raff,\" he said---\"Raff\", not \"Rayf\" or \"Rallf\"---\"Magic tricks? I can't take you anywhere, can I?\"\n\"Me? I wasn't that pissed, Michael, and I could hear what you were up to in there. Banging on about him and 'im, as usual. You can't leave it alone, can you? One of these days we'll have trouble at home. Walls,\" he said, and he seemed drunk again now as he looked from side to side and up and down and behind the hedge (but he was drunk enough not to see me, at any rate), \"have ears. And eyes. And noses. And-\"\nMike put a hand on his shoulder. \"All right, Raff. You've made your point. Let's go home.\"\nThere was a shuffling noise and I thought, well, now they've made up is my chance. I didn't want to miss 'em so I was rushing a bit, and I skidded through the gate and onto the pavement. But they were both gone already. When I looked down Hodson Crescent they weren't there, and there was no sign of them up and down Cadmon. I'm damned if I know where they went to. One minute they were there, then they were gone, I swear. The third weird thing. But I felt a bit light-headed, to be honest. That last VRB had got to me, probably. I couldn't drink like Mike and I certainly couldn't drink like Ralph or Rayff or Raph or whatever he was called. I headed back to the house to have more of the RB and less of the V. I'd had enough of spirits for that night.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/social-event.html"},{"title":"Sol y sombre","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    23 Sep 2001        \n        \n\nWith the two glasses of spirit he had poured at the bar, Oliverio Paio picked his way across the tiled floor, swinging his tapered legs to place one shiny shoe in front of the other. He was shaped like a pinstriped balloon, head perched with its pointed beard, on the flat of the balloon's top. A big man, he was nonetheless not flabby, but solid; not even muscle, just taut flesh.\nThe liquid spun in the two glasses, like gyroscopes keeping him balanced on his tightrope, and he headed smoothly towards Mr Barnaby. Mr Barnaby was grateful for the air-conditioning, and the villa's sweet shade. He felt sunburnt and raw, although a long, icy shower had improved his humour and removed his sweat and itches. Within polite earshot - a few metres away - he began to speak. His English was good, if a little too formal, and accented with a mix of Madrid and received-pronunciation.\n\"Senor Barnaby. I am very relieved that you are arrived here safely. And with your delivery intact. We - that is, my employees - heard that you had been followed from the airport. It was only a lack of initiative on the part of someone working for the hire car firms there that you were not taken under their wing. When they saw your... tail, you were already on the bus and the bus was already leaving. So. Drink this.\" He had sat down during this speech, like he was performing a flowing dance move. The sofa they both sat on was part of an extravagant suite that sapped Mr Barnaby's will to stay awake. The cream-coloured covering moulded to his limbs and did not stick like plastic.\nHe accepted the glass and Senor Paio continued. \"Good. It is a Spanish drink, not from here. From the east coast. It is called sol y sombre, the sun and the shade. Given the colour of red you seem to have turned, it is appropriate. But in this country, the name is appropriate for many months of the year. Consider it an aperitif. We eat soon, unless you would rather rest a while.\"\nMr Barnaby took a sip of the sol y sombre. A brandy smoothness wrapped around sharp anis, which caught in his throat, almost made him cough. It woke him up a little, and he noticed the faint smell of coffee and food in the air. He felt hungry. \"That should be fine, Senor Paio. I haven't eaten since breakfast, and I'm famished.\"\nSenor Paio grinned. \"No trouble at all, Mr Barnaby. We can talk about something other than business. But first: you may like to know that I have contacted our associates based on what you have brought me. I cannot guarantee what else will be done, but I expect that there will be a delivery within a few days, and our friends will wish to intercept it. So there will be another courier, and another courier followed. We will have the upper hand, though. We will intercept their package, because we have prior knowledge. Thanks to you.\"\nPerhaps Mr Barnaby did not seem pleased enough - a twinge of guilt passed over his face, or perhaps it was a cough of anis - but Senor Paio continued: \"there will be no rough treatment, Mr Barnaby. I can assure you we are not guilty of that yet, and we have many more means at our disposal. Although Miguel might have been conspicuous to you on the mountain....\" Senor Paio trailed off, and Mr Barnaby did not consider it appropriate to mention that he had barely noticed Miguel until the very last moment.\n\"We seem to spin the world, Mr Barnaby. We spin the world faster, and faster, and the last person to fall off wins! But for now, Mr Barnaby - we eat!\" Saying this, Paio slapped his hands onto his knees, and stood up as though his joints belonged to someone thirty years his junior. He waited for Mr Barnaby to achingly make his own way to his feet, then gestured towards the kitchen, following Mr Barnaby and talking all the while.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/sol-y-sombre.html"},{"title":"Some mistake","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    19 Jan 2005        \n        \n\nNils left the house at nine o'clock precisely. More punctual than the sunrise, Nils took no small delight in the seasons that varied around him. He would sample the air and the light at the same point in the earth's rotation each day, and could thus feel summer's approach and guess at winter's onslaught.\nHe sniffed, his wide nostrils dilating to let in the air that today slouched over from the direction of Tansberg. The light was brighter today; Nils smiled, as he loved the spring and saw every sign of it as a blessing. The time in which diurnal creatures could sport and build had been extended by some six minutes since yesterday, he thought, picturing the almanack in his mind's eye.\nHe pulled his greatcoat around him as he stepped onto the snow-covered pavement. The flurries had finished during the night, but persistent flakes still tapped on the thick woollen garment. The month was thus far unseasonably cold, although the weather had suggested these past few days that it might soon break.\nAn especially bitter personal winter was thawing for Nils. His profession was that of manager of a ragtag assemblage of joiners and plumbers, that his superior, a town councillor, imagined was a construction outfit; despite their apparent disorganization they were brought together by the respect and friendship (not, it must be stressed, at all an unsuitable relationship between governor and governed) that Nils showed to every employee on every day of work. Under his direction they never failed to make a decent fist of most simple, small-town jobs.\nHowever, in late autumn an accident involving unsecured guide-ropes had caused Nils to be struck with a sturdy wooden beam, and he had lost consciousness for three days. On waking, he had not been able to remember the events leading up to the accident at at all; severe concussion and its after-effects had afflicted him for many weeks afterwards; Nils felt he had yet to fully recover.\nThe firm had been generous to a fault, and had provided for him during his convalescence. A naturally sociable man, Nils was nonetheless saddened that no representative had ever called on him; nor had any of his underlings, with whom he had had such warm, reciprocated relationships at work, enquired after his health. But he understood the natural revulsion at another's infirmity, and did not bear a grudge easily. So he expected to stay at home another month or two so that he might fully recover; then he would reappear at the offices with renewed vigour.\nAs he turned the corner onto the Rallarvei he brushed shoulders with a young gentleman. Nils thought nothing of it; the young man looked up and then, seeing Nils, touched his cap and said, grinning: \"Good to see you, sir.\" Perplexed, Nils smiled in response. Closeted for so long, and then accustomed to walking streets that had been swept clean by the arctic winds, his once well-developed social faculties had wilted somewhat, as though he were reading a guide to manners that had bleached and weathered over the past few months. So he was in a sense unsurprised at his surprise, at how he had been greeted. Besides, the gentleman had been quite young, and so what had struck Nils as a faintly gauche, overaffectionate greeting was probably precisely that.\nIn his healthier days, Nils had made regular trips to the local grocer's. He had schooled with Jan Anderssen, the owner, and was always pleased to see him. Each visit had been almost entirely the same as the previous one, and although he had not been there for some months he could still remember every item he usually bought. So it was a surprise to find that Anderssen's store had changed hands while Nils had kept himself indoors.\nAs Nils entered the woodpanelled shop, he was greeted from afar by the new owner's fat face. Topped with greasy hair plastered to his head like a skullcap of black leather, and festooned with a billowing black moustache, it beamed across the counter at him. A wiry young smudge of flour and stock-room dust moved in the shadows of the shop. He was fourteen, perhaps fifteen, and sloped round the room as if to leave his feet behind. As Nils approached the counter, the boy began unloading sacks and packages of produce from a wheelbarrow onto the shelves.\nNo less friendly than Herr Anderssen, the new fellow greeted Nils warmly and asked him his opinion of the weather.\n\"All is as it should be,\" Nils said gnomically, and thought it worth repeating. \"As it should be.\"\n\"I quite agree, sir,\" said the shopkeeper cheerily, barely listening to himself, let alone his customer. \"And I wouldn't be surprised if spring were fast approaching....\" And so his patter continued, leading gently through enquiries about Nils' habits and preferences into the subject of what he wished to obtain from the store that day. Nils felt immersed in his talk as if in hot, steaming porridge, and began ordering the fellow around the shop as confident as a customer ever were; the shopkeeper, in his turn, fetched from the shelves behind him with equal aplomb.\nHowever, Nils had only reached the third item on the list when the shopkeeper said: \"Very good, Herr Haaland. And next?\"\nNils stopped, and looked puzzled. \"You are mistaken, sir. Who is this Herr Haaland of whom you speak?\"\nThe shopkeeper's face darkened under his greasy curls. \"My apologies, sir,\" he stammered, looking askance at his assistant who had paused momentarily in his stacking of goods. Suddenly the shopkeeper called out \"Jakob! Get back to work! I want to see those shelves full by midday! I must indeed have been mistaken,\" he continued, addressing Nils once again. \"Do you wish to buy anything else?\"\nUnsettled, Nils realized he had entirely forgotten his list of groceries, his weekly routine upset. Whatever force had been driving his purchases now left him, and after adding some smoked fish and cabbage to his only partly full bag he paid for the goods and hurried out of the shop. The door clattered shut behind him.\nNils chewed on his thoughts as he began to head home. Who was Haaland?  Had he moved here these past few months? Was the physical resemblance truly so strong between them? The youth, on the Rallarvei: perhaps he had thought Nils to be this Haaland fellow. Maybe the Haalands were relations; Nils knew of none in his family, but some languishing branch of its tree might have dropped settlers into the northern farms....\nAs he mulled this over he suddenly realized that a young couple, trudging towards him, were looking straight at him, meeting the gaze he now found himself returning. He was dressed very finely, like a town dignitary, and Nils wondered who he might be; she was prim and self-conscious, but Nils could not comment further than that on women's clothing, even in winter.\n\"Well, bless my soul!\" exclaimed the dapper young gentleman. \"Herr Haaland: is it really you? You're looking fine today, isn't he, Inge?\"\nWith a brittle, cheery air, the woman who was presumably called Inge (although what accounting did there seem to be any more for names?) chimed: \"Yes, indeed! I think this fresh air is doing all of us the power of good!\"\n\"Please!\" Nils cried. \"You are both of you mistaken. I assure you that you have confused me with someone else. Your well-wishes are as much appreciated as they are misdirected. Now, good-day to you both.\" And he pushed his way between them and stomped off down the road.\nHe would go to the town hall, he decided. Mentally leafing through his address book—Nils had a fine mind for such details—he remembered one or two acquaintances that might appreciate the quandary in which he found himself, and would let him look through the most recent pages of the matrikkel, at least. He might then check the records for a Herr Haaland. It was unlikely that the gentleman had moved into the small town, but perhaps he was a new arrival in one of the smallholdings or bruker dotted around. The situation had become wholly embarrassing to Nils. Armed with a bruksnummer he could find and confront Herr Haaland, and attempt some sort of resolution. With a flash of humour, he wondered if Herr Haaland might be persuaded to grow a beard to make it easier to distinguish them both.\nAs he mounted the steps to the records office he saw, through the panes in the door, an official scurrying to meet him. Nils was struck with a sudden premonition that was ghastly to him, and he saw the name form on the lips of the servile face that approached his own.\n\"Herr Haa-\"\nNils' delicate temperament was finally smashed to pieces. He thrust his bag of shopping into the arms of the official, pushing him back through the doorframe. \"Get away!\" he roared. \"Jubelidiot! I am surrounded by fools! Do I look so much like this Herr Haaland that you must pester me so? To hell with you!\" And he leapt away from the entrance hall and ran down the road.\nCareering through the snow on the Rallarvei, Nils was pursued by real and imagined appeals for Mr Haaland to stop and talk awhile. Enquiries about his health mingled with clanging mistakes of his identity, and he bounded up the stairs of his house with Haaland, Haaland in his ears. Almost as soon as he landed on the top step his wife, who had been peering out of the window, clearly fretting, swung the door open and tried unsuccessfully to usher her husband in without stepping into the cold herself.\n\"Nils, my darling,\" Bergitta cried \"You are so late! I did not expect you to be out more than an hour. And in your condition! I was worrying terribly. I should never have let you leave in the first place. Let me call Maren. She can make you some soup, and you can warm yourself in front of the fire.\"\nBut wild-eyed, gasping for breath, he turned to his wife. \"Dear lady,\" he gasped. \"Who is Nils? You are, I am afraid, sadly mistaken. Sadly mistaken.\" This said, Nils Haaland bounded up the stairs and into his room.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/some-mistake.html"},{"title":"Some more attempts at chick-lit","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    26 Jan 2002        \n        \n\n[Picture of legs on the front cover of a book.

It billowed behind him like an infernal smoke, clung to his shoes and tried to suck moisture out of the leather, to crack and ruin the polish. The sun, stupefied by its own heat, continued to press down on the landscape, squeezing out complication from Mr. Barnaby's head.\nThere had not been a single cloud since his walking took him close to the sea. He had kicked and rolled tiringly over shingle. The pebbles, he had guessed, were stacked perhaps a foot deep in places. Each smoothed stone had contained fire, had been a hot coal that ground against its neighbours and Mr. Barnaby's feet. As he had paused to take breath, the air emerging a little cooler than it was inhaled, a shadow had passed over him. Cast by a scruffy tuft of vapours. And, succeeded by two much smaller companions, it had looked like a cartoon thought bubble. Indeed, as it passed over him, the relief of shade had enabled him to start thinking and get his bearings. Looking round, and trying to remember the maps he had been shown, he had pointed his shoes full of mangled, jangling bones inland. The cloud had then passed. \n It had been a mistake to start walking. The airlessness of the bus had been a fat, sweaty man sitting on his lap; it had made him itchy, clammy and, moreover, paranoid. He had become certain that a young man at the back of the bus was watching him. Given his circumstances, Mr. Barnaby had taken the opportunity of the bus breaking down to strike out on his own. \n Now he headed towards what he hoped was Paio's villa, off the autopista that he had left - to take a short cut - an hour ago. His suit jacket was crumpled in his left hand, soaking up a little palm-sweat. A white envelope, fattened to a few stiff millimetres, poked out his the waistband and pressed into the small of his back - reassuringly. When he had removed his jacket, he could not conscience leaving his innocuous-looking cargo in the inside pocket, to the whims of however his twitching hand folded and refolded the material. \nIn his right hand he carried a sports bag containing the few things he had thought he would need for the trip. There was nothing in there, of course, that might be of use in this bizarre eventuality. No trainers, or cool clothes, or a hat or cold water. The bag had very little structure and he was sure that all the clothes inside would now be well creased. It was perhaps this that had made Mr Barnaby decide, in a way that he was not fully conscious enough, not to put the envelope in with his mess of clothes.\n The heat fuelled a buzzing in his ears. His legs were getting heavy, and he felt as though he was climbing. He stopped, swaying a little. Straightening his back he scanned the horizon, and realised he had been climbing. Behind him and then below him stretched the sea and the coast. A long breakwater made a discontinuity in the pattern of the waves. Two sailboats gave the illusion of being stationary. The panorama made him think of a long draught of cold water, renewing faith in his sparse memory of the terrain. He convinced himself that contour lines had to be cut, and pressed onwards, upwards.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/spanish-dust.html"},{"title":"Spoiled fruit","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    9 Apr 2007        \n        \n\nHe had a grandstand view of her descent from across the road. It was quiet at that time, and he was sure that there was nobody else who might have seen.\nShe had been walking along distractedly, swinging her shopping not so much from frivolity as fatigue, when her foot connected with the raised edge of a shattered paving slab. From the moment she began to head towards the ground, to when she finally came to rest, he counted from one to twenty quickly in his head. It was a nervous tic he'd carried over from his childhood into adult life: when he saw or was involved in some stressful event, he began counting to himself. He always tried to do so at the same speed as he might speak quickly; that goal was sometimes a distraction, though, as it sometimes caused his lips to move in sympathy, and when he felt them twitch he had to cease his enumerations.\nShe took so long to fall because she was so big. Not tall, but round and heavy, so not only did it take a lot to unseat her, and a long time for the shock to reach as far as the top of her frame, but once she headed for the pavement her very bulk kept her moving. And so she had tripped over the broken pavement, taken a few wobbly, fat steps, and finally let her confused legs give way, and she seemed to be heading with finality towards the ground, when her body rolled itself quickly into a ball round her ample stomach. Bits of her seemed to be trying to evade the impact by folding upwards into other bits. Shaped like that she was able to roll as she struck the floor, almost turning the accident into a balletic manoeuvre. She ended up sat on her behind, having completed a full forward-roll; extremities bruised, and surprise (and a little shock) on her squashy, expressive face.\nThe two bags she had been carrying were now half-empty. One, a weak blue-striped plastic bag, had torn and disgorged some of the fruit from its inside. Hard, unripe oranges rolled around, nosing up against the wall of the terrace's gardens, or settling comfortably in other divots in the pavement or against the kerb they had just fallen off; a half-dozen pears had aged some ten days in their short trip to the floor, ripening, bruising and then turning to mush in a bounce or two. The other bag was made from canvas and had some sort of charity logo on it; it was undamaged, but during the woman's acrobatics it had tried to follow her and tipped out some of the heavier objects inside. Two tins of pulses had each sustained a slight dent, but the kilogramme of flour was still entire, safe in its paper wrapping.\nBarely had the whole performance come to an end when he was already striding across the quiet road to pick her up. He could see her gasping for air, eyes wide; she couldn't have been more surprised had he just landed her in a fishing-boat. Wiry and teenage, he was able to reach her within two of her panicked breaths. This was a social situation with which he was comfortable: there was a formula, and he began to follow it to the letter. As he reached her he asked \"Are you OK?\" He could see—he hoped—that nothing was broken, and she hadn't hit her head, so he offered her an arm. Shyly, though: he looked away from her as he did so, unwilling to meet her eyes.\nShe grabbed onto him clumsily and he tensed himself as they both began to rise. She folder her legs beneath her and suddenly, spare arm wheeling, jacked her body up, pulling down sharply on his elbow as she did and almost overbalancing them both. But he steadied himself quickly, shifting his feet, and they both managed to lean on each other as far as uprightness. He could smell her as they rose: someone she knew smoked, not her, as the smell of cigarettes lay nauseatingly under the tang of her own sweat, which was itself tinged with panic. The rough twill of her overcoat rubbed against his thinner clothes, and this texture against texture set his teeth on edge.\nFinally, straining at the effort of getting up so slowly, they found themselves vertical. She disengaged from him and, swaying as she turned at the hips, batted dirt and dust, both real and imaginary, off her clothes.\n\"Thank you,\" she puffed, turning to look at his downcast eyes (which in turn looked at nothing in particular), and started to move towards the food that was still littering the pavement.\n\"You lean on the wall. I'll sort it.\"\nHe entwined his thin fingers around the two tins, holding them both in one hand, and then took the bag flour in his other hand; the woman held her better bag out for him to drop it all in, thanking him again, but he just nodded. He went for the oranges next, carrying them in multiples and feeling them push against each other in their tough skin.\nAs she held the other bag out for these he hesitated and said: \"It's split.\"\nShe looked down and saw her own feet through the gaping hole in one corner, and barked a short laugh. \"Oh, yes, you're right! Well, put them in here, then,\" she said, cat's-cradling between the two bags and managing—just—to bury the broken one in the other and open that one wide, without losing a grip on it. He dropped the fruit in one by one, trying to avoid the hard seams of the tins that might split their skin, and heard them plop against the canvas or the flour bag.\nNext he tried to salvage some of the pears, and decided that he would save whichever would leave his fingers dry. As he was gingerly plucking the whole fruit from the burst, a youngish man—older than himself, about as skinny, but hard in straight denim and leather lines—danced past between him, the woman and all the fruit. He trod in the mush of two or three pears, flattening one that might have been rescued, glanced down at his shoes, then carried on up towards the church.\n\"Watch out!\" he snapped at the interloper, not loudly but it carried. The man turned round and sniffed at them both, feigning uninterest in what, for him, might as well have been street theatre.\nThe woman had returned to leaning on the wall, rubbing her hip where a bruise might have been forming. \"Ignorant,\" she said, shaking her head. The movement made her voice all the more jittery; she was clearly feeling the impact now, he thought, and hastened with his task. \"Not like you, love,\" she continued, and from her voice he knew she was looking at him again. \"You're a good boy, do you know that? I hope your mother knows what a good boy you are.\"\nHe glowed; almost smiling; mumbled something about how he was only doing what was right.\n\"Ah, it's knowing what that is that counts,\" she declared, and that set her off on a rambling speech that he tried not to listen to. He was still hunting round for any remaining lost pears and didn't want to be distracted. Apparently, though, not everyone these days was like him, especially not her two sons, although her daughter at least helped out round the house. It was a crying shame, he learned as he was rooting under the back bumper of a car for a miraculously preserved pear, which she said he shouldn't bother with as he'd got most of them, and that would do her fine. As he straightened and returned all the fruit he was carrying to her bag she said once again what a good boy he was, and once again he could feel the blush dawning on his cheeks and he just bowed slightly in response, an oddly theatrical and antiquated little gesture that he meant to be less notable than it was. So he mumbled a bit more to cover up his discomfort, and she eventually smiled and complimented him some more.\n\"Do you need help home?\" he asked flatly. \"I'm just parked up on the superstore car-park if you're still feeling shaky.\"\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, \"I'll be just fine now.\" She dusted herself down one more time as if to prove it. \"I've only got to go up to the end of the road anyway. Thank you so much again!\" She turned and left him, limping a little as she walked, looking more carefully at the pavement than before.\n\"No problem,\" he called after her. He stood where he was for a half a minute, as her bulk waned into the distance, and then abruptly turned to walk back to the car.\nIn comparison to the activity on the pavement, his drive home was uneventful. The hand-me-down engine held out all the way, and no warning lights cried or mewed at him. The traffic, once he had left the suburbs, was thin enough that he was only overtaken once. He never broke the speed limit, not even on the motorway, as his mother frequently told him the story about his uncle, who was struck by a van as it took corner too quickly. If it hadn't have been speeding, she'd said, poor Uncle Mick might have stood a chance, and that always stuck with him when he was on his own in the car. He could play the whole story—all the details she'd mentioned over the course of the telling and re-telling—in his head, like a radio station, and did so now. It kept him calm and considerate through the estates and along the lane that went under and past the bypass. When he finally turned into the drive he had almost forgotten the woman he'd helped, and forgotten her praises. He remembered it all again, in a flash, and for a third time his cheeks turned red.\nThe house was still empty—his parents were out, his sister was out, and one of them must have taken the terrier Harry-Jarry as the leash was not on its hook—so he let himself in and made a cup of tea. He got a tub of biscuits out of a cupboard and took them through to the lounge to watch the television. He switched it on and clicked through a few of the channels until he found a western, which he'd seen before. It had been fun, though: not Dirty Harry or anything, but one of the really good ones. He could remember the title, and all the main actors, although last time he'd had to go off to do the washing-up before the credits finished, so he had never got to the producer and director. As guns blazed and women in red, flouncy dresses pouted and men with stubbly beards did the decent thing, he began to stare a little glassy-eyed at the happenings on screen, relaxing a little and just soaking it in.\nHe found himself working his way through the day's schedule, starting from the top. There were the library books, and dropping those parcels off for his mum at the post office. Then there was the hardware shop for a new kettle, and of course the supermarket for the weekly shop. After that... after that he'd been busy helping that woman, and then had come home.\nMentally ticking these items off one by one, he suddenly remembered that he still had to empty the car boot; he jumped up and headed outside. There was bits and pieces of shopping: the kettle, and something else from the hardware shop that he could barely remember getting: rubbish really, he'd never use it. Then there was fruit and vegetables, along with some pasta, bread and tins, and some once-frozen food that was now just cool and a little dewy in its packaging. He pulled all of this out in its four big bags, bending from the base of his spine and feeling a twinge of discontent there as he did so. Then, finally, nestling behind the back seats of the car, were his tools. He hefted a lump-hammer in one hand and a crowbar the length of his arm in the other. The business ends of both were tainted with grubby grey powder and a little dirt.\nThat slab had been difficult to deal with, he remembered with a grimace. He had had to hammer the crowbar into the gap between the stones, and that counted, he was sure, as very poor treatment of his tools. Not only that, but he was just fortunate between the messing and the banging and the noise that he hadn't been caught this time. Still, it had all been worth it. After all, she had told him so herself: he had been such a good boy.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/spoiled-fruit.html"},{"title":"Stanley Manly","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    28 Nov 2000        \n        \n\nWoah! Stan, eh? Stan The Man! Remember Stan? Ahh, you must remember him, everybody knows Stan. Such a great bloke, he really is. Always got an answer to any question, and the answer is: Stan!\nI remember when I first met him. Oh, it must be a few years ago now. A little pub out in North London, it was. I'd been having such a rough time of things, and I remember, the first thing he said was: \"it could be worse.\" It could be worse, eh? We must've talked for hours that night, and he didn't half cheer me up. Me and Stan talked all the way home - he only lived a few streets away back then - and he really talked some sense into me. When I got home, my housemates must've wondered what had got into me!\nSaw Stan a few times after that. He'd pop round, ask me if I wanted to sink a few beers with him, soak up some of his old philosophy! Always when I needed cheering up too. I remember one thing he used to say: \"never trust women,\" he'd say. And he was absolutely right. I never have. But I felt I could tell Stan whatever was wrong with my life, and if he didn't know what to do, he'd at least be a sympathetic ear. Dependable, was Stan.\nWe drifted apart, I suppose. Maybe Stan only hung around when I needed him, like some sort of guardian angel or something, and when he realised I was coping better, he just drifted off. But I still think of him, and I see him every now and again, just popping through. We never have a lot of time free now, though, so it's always a flying visit.\nI'll never forget what he taught me. He's always in the back of my mind, is Stan, always giving me cues and warnings, letting me know he's right. He's always right, you know. He was a good one, was Stan.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/stanley-manly.html"},{"title":"Stay calm","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    26 Dec 2004        \n        \n\nYou wake up and everything is wrong; you can't understand it but everything is wrong. The shock of it propels you into an upright position, like the horrible last second of a nightmare, and you look around the room. Surely you're simply muggy with sleep? Isn't the tail end of a dream wrapped round you still, twirling the sense of the world into a spiral every time you turn your head? Well?\nStare towards the window opposite the headboard and the pillows. The net curtains are drawn across it, and each casts a half-shadow with a brilliant gap in between. The light coming through the netting is too pale, and the thin block of glowing floor that echoes the gap is bright white, like moonlight. Or... fluorescent light. Artificial. Now look down. The duvet feels lumpy, and the cover looks different. The pillows in their cases are brand new and crisp under your skin, and plumped up as if you've only just dropped your head onto them.\nYou swing your legs out of the bed that, you now realise, isn't yours, isn't the one you bedded down in. Your feet both pad onto a carpet you don't own. The pattern: how is it different? It is, isn't it, but how? There's something wrong with the print. Perhaps it's slightly deregistered, like a newspaper where one primary ink has slipped by a millimetre. You can't be sure because it isn't that obvious. But the designs and florets still swim before your eyes. What has actually changed about it?\nWhat's going on?\nHalf-straighten yourself into a half-crouch and gangle gollumlike over to the wardrobe. You're not scared yet, or at any rate not petrified, but you've been made wary. Yet even the wardrobe is... wrong: you can tell before you have a chance to click open the double doors. The mirror set into one door has been changed, the silvering no longer corroded as much as it was. As you looked closer even the plywood frame is a different mix, paler wood, less tightly packed. Pull on the handle—the unexpected waxiness of it makes your stomach twitch and your face seize into a cringe, and the catch sounds weak and plastic)—and the door squeaks open.\nThere, confronting you, is a row of someone else's clothes, someone who dresses almost the same as you. They sway mutely, patiently. They make you think of carcasses in a cool-room, waiting for whatever happens after physical death. Closer to the floor the fabrics blend into an obscene tangle of partly distinguishable items, layered with the straps of smelly sports bags and studded with sweaty shoes: someone else's smell; someone else's sweat. In an orgy of fabrics the arms of jumpers cling to the legs of trousers, which wrap themselves around the necks and hoods of sweaters. A boot you don't recognise sticks out of a mass of blood-red wools. Its tongue and eyes leer at your incomprehension. Finally fearful, you back away until your shins touch the bed, and the shock sits you down too quickly onto the sheeted mattress, hard and clammy on your skin.\nHow? What has happened? Have all these little swaps been made over a long time, and only now the scales fallen from your eyes? Or have you spent the night doped up, as maleficient armies, devils and Rumplestiltskins, trooped through the room? You feel dozy and headachy, and wonder. Can you remember the last few hours of last night? No? Perhaps that was what had happened. Who has done this to you—\nWhat time is it? Shouldn't you be at work? Quick: plough through the strange bedclothes, fighting the waves of nausea, to reach the alarm clock. A present from your grandfather, a clacky old thing that kept you awake when you were only five or six, but has sent you right off to sleep every night since. Yet, as your hand closes on the clock you want to burst into tears: it isn't the one you checked and wound last night.\nSeven seventeen, the face says. So you're early for work. But, you wonder, what day is it? If you've been drugged, then for how long?\nOnce again you look round, this time frantically. Your head swishes from side to side and you feel as if the walls are closing in and you try exhaling at the same time as inhaling and it doesn't work properly and it's only by chance that you see a piece of paper on the bedside table, under the alarm clock, a note in your own scrawly handwriting. It reads:\n\"Zitupafralam - expect weirdness! Dr says mild cognition probs may occur. STAY CALM. Me.\"\nRead it. No, no, no, a voice is telling you. No. This note is as wrong as the rest of the room, it says, all wrong, one big mistake, and—but scan through it again. And a third time. Take a breath, in, out, and re-read. Each repetition leaves you more relaxed, like some meditation manouevre. This note: it is you then, telling you now, not to worry.\nYou feel the last vestiges of sleep evaporate, and dimly, déjà vu, you remember writing the note. You even remember the consultation at the doctor's; or, at any rate, a scene in his office presents itself, scented with antiseptic. It must. It must have been. It was. It was. Yesterday. Yesterday morning. Not that long ago. But you had taken the day off like so many days recently. This one, though, wasn't spent lying in bed and calling in sick (sick in your soul); instead, after the doctor wrote a prescription, you took it straight to the chemist. It was worth it. Anything was worth not waking up again so very, very unhappy. This was a better option than some you'd thought of, in darker moments.\nYou took the first dose last night, early on. You felt fine, absolutely fine; only, sleepily, you sloped to bed soon afterwards. And, this morning, you were happy for that first half a second. Weren't you? Before this side-effect manifested itself, and that's all it is, a side-effect.  Nothing more. So ssh, you say to yourself. Ssh. All those anti-depressants are the same, really: loose cannons rolling around inside the head, and along with defending your sanity they can blow holes in its side. Some squeeze the personality into a dumbell-shape, two ridiculous, heavy poles linked by a delicate joist; some make you chew like a rabbit. The zitupafralam is responsible, must be responsible for this —you wrote so yourself, remember?—weirdness.\nYour heartbeat slows and subsides in your ears. The novelty of waking up, for the first time in two years, without depression crushing your first few thoughts of the day begins to dawn on you. At last! and it has worked astonishingly well, considering, and so quickly: overnight. In a different frame of mind you see that sunlight redden, becoming a joyful morning orange that zings off the net curtains and the tiny strip of floor. Now scan the room again. See? Each object divests itself of your distrust, sheds and sloughs all its sinister trappings. And you can feel your heart lifting further. Once again, here is your home, surrounding you and keeping you safe.\nFinally, in a spirit of exorcism, look at the alarm clock. Your grandfather's poor, maligned alarm clock. Someone else's indeed! It is your clock and always has been. With each tick this machine has marched its way into the deepest forests of your consciousness, setting up camp and dependably marking time. Can you not hear it, and remember hearing it ten years ago, and in your mind's eye see yourself sitting up in bed listening to it then as you do now?\nIf anything in this room is real then this, your oldest possession, has to be.... There are markings on its base. Scratches? You could never have noticed them before: only from this angle are they visible. They can't be scratches, as they look too regular. A hallmark? A logo? Turn the clock fully upside down. Two words, in a typeface eighty years younger than the clock ought to be.\n\"REPLICA CLOCK\".\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/stay-calm.html"},{"title":"Still there?","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    5 Oct 2003        \n        \n\nThey’d ring the single bell in Christ Church: it chimed for every student in.

Often the juxtaposition of two or three or even four such markers led him to put another down in their centre, or on a particular axis of conjunction. Occasionally, with a triumphant flourish, he would take a ruler and pencil from his desk and affirm the arrangement with a permanent line.\nIn this way Rhys spent the next few hours playing what appeared to be some ancient boardgame against himself, thrilling at his own victories, excited even further by his failures.

She had planted herself into the carpet, with the heavy, bulbous writing-desk on her right, drawers and board locked and snapped together, and the dresser looming over her left shoulder, a faded dinner set exhibited on it behind a lattice of vertical dowels, and a collection of family photographs beneath.

The toast was as always the colour of marzipan, had barely felt the heat before being rescued from the toaster. As always too all trace of crust had been removed, lest Mrs Sims' dentures be unable to cope. And the eggshell was still immaculate, awaiting the force of Mrs Sims' own will, still strong enough for her to wield it with a little elderly pride.\nBut, oh, how it could all have been ruined! Because today was different. That's why, although Mrs Sims' tea was stationed between the egg and the tray corner as always—teabag still there to give it \"a bit of body\"—there was another mug beside it. Most of the other mugs were hardly ever used and sat gathering some sort of unidentifiable bakelite dust at the back of Mrs Sims' kitchen cupboards, but he'd dragged one out today, because it was different, and the tea in it was almost as pale as the toast... because today Mrs Sims had a real visitor. Not just him, the home help.\nMrs Sims' daughter didn't come round nearly often enough: Charlie had thought that to himself; Mrs Sims had hinted at it once or twice—but rarely, because she wouldn't be beholden—and her daughter said as much when she apologized for her brazen attempt on her mother's egg.\n\"It's the shifts, you see,\" she explained, stepping back to show she yielded to Charlie, and leaning against the draining-board. Charlie could now get on with the preparations unhindered. He shuffled a bit, to stand square with the tray. \"I've got a bit more leeway now that I'm sister, of course. But I've still got to set an example. So I don't want to seem to be neglecting my duties just because it's me that decides on the rota.\"\nCharlie nodded, and busied himself with the breakfast-making for a moment. It dawned on him that a reply was needed, and he said:\n\"Well, it's certainly perked her up to see you, Miss Sims—\"\n\"Carol, please,\" she replied, and then: \"Really? You think she's happy I've come?\"\n\"Oh, definitely,\" Charlie said, setting his bottom lip in a position that brooked no argument. He thought to himself, though, that it was difficult most days to work out even the primary colour of Mrs Sims' moods; she was so opaque. But it couldn't hurt to say what he'd said.\nHe made one last check of the tray, and then picked it up and headed towards the door. \"Oh, let me hold it open for you,\" Carol said, and bustled round him to the handle. Charlie smiled a thanks and they did a brief dance that resulted, happily, in getting him and his burden into the warmth of Mrs Sims' living-room.\n\"Took your time, Chalkie,\" Mrs Sims said, eyes grinning even if her mouth wasn't.\n\"I was just entertaining your daughter,\" Charlie said, and set the tray down on the low table in front of Mrs Sims' chair. The surfaces clattered together, and Mrs Sims leaned forward automatically to take up one of her toast soldiers.\n\"That's what they call it these days, is it?\" And then, before anyone could reply: \"That's her mug, then, I take it. Bit weak for my tastes. Engaged yet, Carol, dear?\"\nCarol rolled her eyes theatrically, clearly actually annoyed underneath. \"No, not yet, mother,\" she replied wearily, and then to Charlie: \"She asks me that every time I see her.\" She sat down on the sofa, at the end next to her mother's chair, and reached for her mug. Mrs Sims seemed satisfied that the tray was now as it should be.\n\"Well,\" Mrs Sims explained, \"I'm sure you're doing wonderful work on the ward, but you should want more than that. You must have all those lovely doctors chasing you by now. Let one of them catch you, make an honest woman of you. I might see some grandkids before.... I won't be around for ever, you know.\"\nCharlie didn't know what to say. He'd never been very good at small talk. Mrs Sims could usually draw him out of himself a bit, but all her attention was directed at her daughter. He wondered, after all, if Carol was really welcome in the house until suddenly, without making eye contact, Mrs Sims reached over with her free hand and patted Carol's as it rested on the arm of the sofa.\n\"Still, it's lovely to see you, dear. Oh, I just remembered. Ethel Beaman brought round some toffees. Quality Street. I can't abide them myself. But they're just by the side of the sofa, so don't stand on ceremony. Don't eat them all, though. Let Chalkie have a few. Besides, you should be watching your figure.\"\nLater, Charlie and Carol were doing the washing-up. Carol dried what Charlie cleaned. At first she had to ask where each item of crockery went, but eventually it was obvious. Tariq had been looking in on Mrs Sims over the weekend, and he never did the washing up, so there was more to clean than on most week-days. They chatted at the same time, or tried to. Charlie told her at one point that he was never one for chatting. Letting someone know you find chatting difficult makes it all the harder, Charlie knew, but he never learned. So there was a bit of stilted talk, then a pause in which dishes clanked and soapsuds shushed and dripped from plate to bowl and back.\n\"She does go on,\" Carol grumbled after one particularly long pause.\n\"Mrs Sims?\" Charlie asked, although it was obvious. Carol nodded. \"Oh, I think she just wants the best for you. Just doesn't know how to say it.\"\nCarol looked unconvinced. \"She teases me like that every time I see her. I think the only thing it's meant to tell me is that she's still got the power to annoy me.\"\n\"Surely not. She probably wants you to have more fun than she did. Her generation had two wars and not much freedom. She'd just like to see you out enjoying yourself, maybe, instead of working so hard at the hospital.\"\n\"You think?\" Carol asked, looking out of the corner of her eye.\nCharlie carried on rinsing dishes, but noticed the look.\n\"She's a pain in the arse. Sorry, Charlie, but you know what I mean. I love her, but she drives me up the wall.\"\nThey carried on cleaning the dishes.\n\"So you think she'd be happier if I was out chasing men, then?\"\nCharlie laughed, nervously. \"I didn't say that, did I? But maybe you should relax more. Like you said, you're sister now, so you've got breathing space. Maybe fix that rota in your favour every once in a while.\"\nCarol looked at him, for longer this time. \"Are you volunteering your services, then, Charlie? I don't think this sort of thing is covered in home visits.\"\nCharlie looked back at her, then down to the dishes. His face passed through a half-dozen expressions before settling on a kind of polite, thoughtful frown. \"Now, don't get me wrong, Miss- Carol. You're a lovely lady. But I... I'm not sure if you're my type. I mean, if I'm your type. I mean. I'm sure there's lots of fellas out there who would jump at the chance to....\"\nHe tailed off. Carol put down the dish she hadn't been drying for a couple of minutes now. She moved towards Charlie and put a hand on her hip.\n\"Let me tell you something, Charlie. It might come as a bit of a shock.\" Charlie stopped his rinsing and waited. \"That woman in there's sharper than you think. She's probably even sharper than I give her credit for. I don't know what she's told you, but—\" she was quite close now \"—in my time I've had more than my fair share of men, that's for certain.\"\nCharlie started at this, and Carol took her chance to move another step towards the sink. She was now close enough that Charlie's arm and side could somehow tell how close she was, even though she wasn't touching him.\n\"Medical students do a lot of sleeping around, and I joined in when I could. It's all true what you heard about us nurses, you know. Oh, yeah: I've certainly had my fair share of men. And I'll tell you something else,\" she said, a little huskily, moving even closer.\nCharlie swallowed. \"What?\"\n\"So's she. All the men on Ferris Close, but that was demolished before both our time so you won't know how long a road it was. But she's got a notch on the bedpost for each one of the armed services. And a couple for the fire brigade. Heaven knows how many men from the ordnance factory. Like mother, like daughter. So make sure you think of that, next time you're watching her dunk soldiers in her egg.\" She turned away, folded the towel on the rack, and went back to her mother.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/tea-and-similarity.html"},{"title":"That's living","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    26 Sep 2004        \n        \n\nThey sat in a coffee shop off Russell Square. Far off Russell Square, through the radii first of Starbucks coffee, and then the one of houses that served decent coffee. Practically King's Cross by now. The old man added three sugars to the cup; his son, nerves already jangling, had a decaf.\n\"I'm so pleased for you,\" the father said. \"I can't believe it. I still can't believe it. You've been looking for a decent job for so long. And now you're working abroad too! It's almost like the Auf Wiedersehen, Pet!\"\nThe son rolled his eyes. \"I wish we'd never got you UK Gold, Dad. All you ever do is watch that stuff.\"\nHis father barked a laugh: \"Ha! If you hadn't got it, I would never have come over here. What else was there here for me?\" And he began laughing, too long and too hard. He was getting old. When he realized his son had stopped, he stopped too, and sipped his coffee. \"There was you, of course. And your brothers. And,\" he added, \"your mother. I missed her a great deal.\" I'll miss you again now, he thought. When would he next sit down with his son?\nUnprompted, his son shrugged. \"It's only a short contract, you know? But... maybe it will lead to something else. Somewhere else. They're quite good about that.\" They were both quiet again\nDad held his hands in front of him, as if on an absent knife and fork. To be always nervous around one's eldest son, one's pride and joy. Nervous because this boy had been taller than him for years now and no boy at all; nervous at how nowadays he carried all this misery on his manboy's shoulders. It was all her fault, that Samra.... The child he remembered was a curly-haired innocent who used to looked at him with full, liquid eyes as if there was nothing else in the world.\nHe looked at his son and wondered. Made an effort to smile, but suddenly saw the echo of those child's eyes and grinned despite himself.\n\"So,\" he began, but comfortably, \"where are they sending you? Anywhere exciting? Anywhere sunny? Barbados, maybe?\"\n\"Dad...!\" his son admonished, smiling. \"You can't come along. So stop fishing.\"\n\"Who's fishing? I'm just thinking that maybe this could be an opportunity for your father, not just yourself. I could see the world.\"\n\"What, you haven't seen enough just getting here?\"\nHis father shrugged. \"I'd like to see the nicer bits before I die, my boy. The sky over Austria is the same as the sky over Hawaii, but you can't get Pacific sand in Austria.... I wonder what Pacific sand feels like,\" he mused, chewing on his cheek and staring through his son. Then: \"So. Where are they sending you, then?\"\n\"It's not the Pacific. Maybe we'll go to the Pacific one day, though, Dad. Qamal moved out there, didn't he? Got a job in Silicon Valley, one of them dot-coms. I wonder how he's doing?\"\n\"Yes, you used to be such good friends. Thick as thieves, yes? But they're not sending you there, are they?\"\n\"No.\" The son stirred his coffee, although it didn't need it. He put the plastic stirrer down and rearranged himself in his seat. Looking at his coffee he said: \"The job's out east.\"\n\"Eastern Europe? What, Slovakia? The Balkans? What a place! Oh, you'll regret going there, I tell you. I tried getting through the Balkans, you know. Estonia.\"\nPerking up, son said: \"You never told me that, Dad. Didn't you get through in the end?\"\n\"No, it was pretty difficult. People there don't stay bribed, which is very unfair of them. And it was so bloody cold. But, wait, I lose track. Where was it you said you were going?\"\n\"Eastish, maybe south-east.\"\n\"Russia?\"\nHe shook his head; bit his lip; found the words: \"Home, Dad. I'm going home.\"\nHis father's head shook a little. \"No.\"\n\"It's not for long.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Seriously. Dad. It's better than it was. It's changed since you left, you know, and-\"\nBang, went his father's hand on the table, and coffee spilled onto the formica top. Air rattled through his father's mouth.\n\"Do you not see the news?\" he whispered hoarsely to his son.\n\"Yeah, of course I do, but it's-\"\n\"Do you not see the news? You think it's better? You think bombs are better? You think these things you can't predict are better, maybe one day fine, maybe the next, you're lying dead and we never hear? You think that's better? Better than him—that bastard, I'll grant you—but better than him?\"\n\"It's getting better. Dad, come on.\" He squirmed in his seat. \"Let it go.\"\nThe old man didn't want to, but could feel himself doing it. Who was this helping? What good did it ever do, raging and berating anything under the gaze of those eyes? \"Does your mother know?\" he demanded. His son looked at the table top, and said nothing. Father nodded. \"Will you... will you be away long?\"\n\"It's construction, mostly. It's good work.\"\n\"Mostly.\"\nHis son sighed. \"I've got to go.\"\n\"Already?\"\n\"My flight's in three hours. I've got to get to Heathrow.\" He scraped the chair back. \"Thanks for the coffee, Dad. Take care, yeah? I'll ring when I get there.\" He swept round the table and was gone. His father looked straight ahead, and didn't watch him go.\nThe door closed and it was like a light had switched off.  Father no longer saw the coffee shop, its yellow walls and brown seats. He saw a little kid, whacking a stone around with a stick of wood, having learnt the word \"baseball\" and saying it, over and over again. Play baseball. Do baseball. Baseball, baseball, and in the scene the old man could see himself, stood to one side, looking so young and so proud, fit to burst with pride. The boy hit the stone with the very end of the stick, with a long, determined swing that smashed it so far away from them that neither of them saw it land. In the dream his younger self started clapping and hugging his son. Back in the café he blinked again and again, his eyes couldn't stop blinking, but the vision would not go away.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/thats-living.html"},{"title":"They Came To Earth In Crates","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    4 Jun 2004        \n        \n\n\"We can't let the people know, sir.\"\nThe Secretary to the Protector was adamant, but he didn't press the point. He knew that the argument was already won. The Protector, sat opposite him, didn't seem to be listening to a word his secretary said. His chair was turned three-quarters to the right, so that he looked at the wall rather than his employee, and his left hand drummed faintly on the crescent-shaped top of his desk.\n\"Sir?\" the secretary prompted, quietly.\nWith a sigh the Protector nodded, his jowls shaking.  The most powerful man on the planet looked old and haggard; his eyes were the eyes of someone who hadn't slept for perhaps two straight days. Only his secretary knew that the Protector had been awake for at least four, and was actually looking remarkably well. The secretary nodded back, a single, controlled tilt of the head.\n\"Two shipments have arrived today,\" the secretary said, his manner becoming businesslike. \"Over three thousand, two hundred crates. That leaves just under nine thousand crates to arrive, uh-\" (the secretary flicked through the contents of his pad, which bleeped in protest) \"-in five days time. Four ships, including the Manticore.\"\nThe Protector's eyes flickered and he swivelled round towards the secretary. \"The Manticore? Are you sure that's wise? The flagship of the fleet?\"\nThe secretary scratched the scalp under his forelock. They had both worked together for long enough to know that meant he was feeling anxious. \"It should be fine, sir. We've took steps—cosmetic steps—to make it look like a scow. And it will be flying in under full radar and IR cover, at night.\" He shrugged. \"It was the biggest ship we had, and we needed it.\"\n\"Yes. Yes, you're right. Well. Distribution: what about distribution?  It's all very well getting all the crates onto the surface, but how will we distribute them among the populace?\"\nAgain the secretary consulted his notes. \"We believe we can achieve at least 90% diaspora within... oh, within the week following arrival of all crates, Protector. And without anybody knowing. We can proceed faster than that but there's a greater risk that people will learn the truth about the crates.\"\nThe truth hung in the air between them, momentarily. His secretary's eyes followed his gaze as the Protector glanced out of the window. The secretary took a breath and continued.\n\"I have seconded the necessary departments and their ministers already, of course, under Protection Act 117. We can therefore use the ministries' normal delivery methods, and this should arouse the least suspicion.\"\n\"Who will be in charge of delivery?\"\n\"Minister Findley has recommended a trusted aide of his, a Mr McLaghlin, previously Captain McLaghlin. Still is, I suppose. I will brief him fully on the task ahead.\"\nThe Protector nodded. \"Word must not get out, Secretary.\"\n\"No, Protector.\"\n\"Imagine how bad it would be for morale. Nobody else must know. Ever.\"\n\"Yes, Protector.\"\nThe old man turned away. He began tapping his fingers on his desk again. His secretary wondered if he had been dismissed, and he was about to rise from his seat when the Protector said suddenly:\n\"We are doing what's right, aren't we, Secretary?\"\nThe secretary paused. From the way his master had spoken, he couldn't be sure if the question was really directed at him, or at some tribunal or impeachment council many years in the future.\n\"Protector, we're doing everything we can.\"\n\"Do everything you can to keep this quiet, McLaghlin,\" the secretary told Minister Findley's aide. They had met up later that day in the vast storage bin set aside—in total secrecy—for the cargo arriving from the colonies. It was the interior of a hollowed-out mountain, created as an emergency bunker during the Last Great War. A few hours after each ship had come in, landing in a burst of fire and steam, wisps of cloud had begun to form near the ceiling of the bunker. The pilot of the second ship had sworn he had felt rain.\n\"How am I to distribute the crates, sir?\" McLaghlin was a military man, with a clipped voice that chewed the end off each sentence.\n\"Normal channels. Completely normal channels. I have instructed the staff at the relevant departmental warehouses and you will be permitted to deliver crates to these locations-\" (he handed McLaghlin a sheaf of documents) \"-under these pretexts-\" (another sheaf.) \"Make sure you match them up, as the staff at each warehouse have obviously not been briefed on the true nature of your cargo.\"\nMcLaghlin looked round the vast, two-thirds empty space ahead of him. He couldn't tell if their voices had been echoing or not during the conversation. Whatever noise had been returned from the far-flung walls was too weak and too delayed.\n\"How many crates in total, sir?\"\n\"Twelve thousand by the end of the week. We will provide flash transport capable of handling five hundred crates at a time. Leave the Pacific journeys till last, as they will take longest.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\"Anything else?\" the secretary asked. McLaghlin paused, and the secretary found it refreshing that someone was, for once, thinking about the answer to a question before submitting it.\n\"No, sir,\" he eventually barked.\n\"This comes straight from the Protector, McLaghlin. Tell nobody. We cannot let this become common knowledge.\"\nWith the minister gone, McLaghlin relaxed. Although he had been told what was in those crates, it was only fair that he make sure for himself. This wasn't curiosity; years of service in the fleet squeezed the curiosity out of men like McLaghlin. This was simple contingency planning. Until he could believe that the contents of the crates were what he had been told they were, then he had no confidence in the plans that the secretary had made. Professionalism: that was all. A little maverick, but the secretary would surely understand.\nHe wandered over to an old supply cupboard, and rummaged around inside it for a suitable implement. By luck there was a claw hammer towards the bottom of a pile of brushes and cleaning materials. He grabbed this and carried it to the nearest wall of wood. There were a few crates standing singly, each around a metre and a half high and several metres long and wide. McLaghlin could see all sides apart from the base on the floor: they were blank, with no markings or lettering of any sort. Close up he thought the wood looked unusual, but couldn't say how: perhaps the trees had been grown in the colonies.\nHe slid the claw in between the lid and body of one of the crates and levered. Nothing. He pushed down harder, and still it did not budge. Finally, he leant on the hammer with all his weight and, with a sensation like a long splinter being eased out, the crate opened and a handful of long nails lost their grip on one half of the join that they bridged. McLaghlin pulled on the lid, grunting as it shifted upwards. There was now a big enough gap and he looked inside.\nIt was full of potatoes.\nHis eyes widened a little. Not sure what to think he checked another crate, which yielded a little more easily to the hammer. Inside were white flakes and husks, like packaging material filling the crate almost to its brim. Wheat, he thought, or maybe corn: he wasn't sure whether or not they were the same thing. He tried another crate, and that was full of barley.\nVegetables. Millions of tonnes, certainly once the rest of the cargo had arrived. McLaghlin had once had to eat hydroponically grown vegetables, and the food in the crates reminded him of those. They were a little too big, as if their growth had been rushed. Looking at the rest of the crates, McLaghlin couldn't begin to guess at the extent of the farms that had produced the contents of all these crates.\nUsing the same hammer he banged the crooked nails back into the crates, sealing them shut. Nobody must know, not even the guards on the gates of this facility. So as he approached those gates he rearranged the expression on his face, pokered it until it was as blank as the wooden boxes behind him.\nThe doors began to trundle apart. As the hot breeze blew in from outside he sniffed, and remembered again why it had come to this. Stepping outside he saw, from one end of the horizon to the other, scorched, dead fields. Not a single plant grew, nor a single insect buzzed. It was the lasting legacy of the Last Great War. McLaghlin looked around him, at the desolation and the dry heat, and silently agreed that the secretary's plan was a good one. Earth, after all, needed all the help it could get.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/they-came-earth-crates.html"},{"title":"They glow, against the skin","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    22 Jan 2008        \n        \n\n1879: Captain Henry Marshal, of the East Surrey Regiment, discovers the treasures of Durr-i-Durran during Khost Valley expedition of the second Anglo-Afghan war. Writing to his betrothed, Agatha Best, Marshal mentions a network of caves under Khost containing a great store of treasure, and implies that he has appropriated some items from the Durranis: \"Would that you had been there, my dearest Agatha, when I rounded a particularly tight corner in that squalid little rabbit-warren to discover such beauty. Not since last leaving your presence.... Perhaps your father will now look more kindly on my decision to join the Young Buffs....\"\nFive days later, in the mountainous territories east of Khost, Marshal is caught in a rockfall. His right arm is entirely smashed to pieces,  necessitating amputation at the scene by Surgeon-Major Preston. Marshal arrives at the camp at Peshawar delirious, and dies shortly thereafter. Marshal's batman, George Eccles, arranges the safe passage of Marshal's personal effects—including some two dozen loose pearls, tightly wrapped in undergarments—out of the country.\n1880: Eccles falls at the battle of Maiwand; Preston is wounded and returns home. The precise location of the riches of the Durrani passes once again into obscurity.\n1883: Agatha Best, now Lady Agatha Hailsham, commissions a necklace to be made from the pearls. The task falls to the world-famous Houndsworth's, a specialist jeweller near Regent Street. Houndsworth's the company has a proud history, stretching back to Queen Elizabeth I's reign, and the grandfather of the company's founder helped work on Anne Boleyn's famous \"B\" necklace.\nBy the 1880s the company is in some difficulty. Nathaniel Houndsworth is in ailing health, but unwilling to hand the reins to his son Martin. The historian Andrew Gillman discusses Nathaniel Houndsworth's condition in some detail: \"racked with pain from arthritis, symptoms of which were especially prominent in the swollen joints of his dominant right hand, Houndsworth could barely handle the jewels, let alone set them with any delicacy of touch.\" Michael Denning, an apprentice during the end of Houndsworth's running of the company, remembers the older man \"bent over his desk like a question mark.\" He was clearly in terrible pain.\n1884: The Khost Necklace is finished. The next day Houndsworth finds his hands utterly unusable: it is believed that his arthritis had been exacerbated by the stress of the company's last commission, and retires. Two months later, following a series of hysterical fits, he is confined in St Anthony's Hospice, Ramsgate. Lady Agatha wears the Khost Necklace to a number of prominent occasions that season.\n1887: At the age of twenty-six, Lady Agatha has an accident while riding on the South Downs. She falls from the horse and lands on rocks, fracturing her skull and causing a blood clot in the brain. Although she survives with her wits intact, much of her right-hand side—arm and leg, and her facial muscles—are weakened by the accident. She is left unable to speak.\n1902: Martin Houndsworth, son of the late Nathaniel, is convicted of fraud. The remaining assets of Houndsworth's are liquidated.\n1922: The eldest daughter of Lord and Lady Hailsham dies of pneumonia, aged thirty-six. She leaves two sons, Andrew and Caspar, and a daughter, Emily.\n1928: Emily Hailsham marries author and essayist Robert Cookson. Robert is a favourite of the Bloomsbury set, and is rumoured to be having an affair with both Virginia Woolf and at least one of the Mitford sisters.\nEmily lives the life of a Bohemian authoress and bon vivant in London; her novels Out of the Water and A Troubled Paradise are released to widespread acclaim in 1929 and 1932. Later works, including Don't Worry About Her (1934), Never Again (1935) and A Lock of His Hair (1939), are received much less favourably and critical opinion gradually turns against her, prolonging her work on the ultimately unfinished The Burford Pariah.\n1934: Lady Agatha dies, leaving Emily to inherit the Khost Necklace.\n1944: During the British invasion of Nazi-occupied France, the now Sergeant Robert Cookson is killed on Omaha Beach. Eye witnesses later confirm his heroism: he attempts to return a live grenade to the enemy, but the ordnance explodes as it leaves his grasp.\n1947: Leaving a society ball, Emily Cookson is involved in a minor accident: her writing hand is slammed in a car door, breaking several small bones. She hires a typist to continue work on The Burford Pariah, but her habit of heavy drinking gradually turns into alcoholism.\n1948: With mounting financial problems Emily Cookson is forced to sell the Khost Necklace. No records exist of the sale, but it is believed to be at an unfavourable price to her major creditor, convicted thief and \"spiv\" Terry White: certainly Emily receives little actual money in return for the necklace.\n1955: Emily Cookson dies of complications arising from delirium tremens.\n1962: Terry White is found murdered; according to autopsy his body contained over two hundred bullets, and his \"shooting hand\" is itself shot entirely to pieces.\n1969: The Khost Necklace resurfaces at auction. Little can be reconstructed about the intervening years, but three jewellers including Michael Denning himself (now aged 97) testify to the likelihood of its veracity. During surface transport to auction, the crate carrying the necklace falls fifty feet from a hoist, and another crate lands on top of it; the necklace is broken and some pearls are lost. The Khost pearls are eventually sold singly to a number of private investors.\n1973: Bryan Stanley Johnson, avant-garde author, commits suicide; a pearl, believed to be from the Khost Necklace, sits beside the bath in which he is found. Friend and agent Michael Bakewell later admits to receipt of the manuscript inspired by Johnson's acquisition, Pearls Before Swiving, or The Nature of the Beast, but it is destroyed during a failed burglary.\n1977: Musician Marc Bolan dies in a car accident. On his right finger is a gold ring with a Khost pearl inset, believed to be a gift from David Bowie. This pearl, like Johnson's, is bought by a private foreign investor.\n2002: Yvonne Chevalier, \"holistic healer to the stars\", buys the five pearls previously unaccounted for. Four of these are ground down to form part of an expensive treatment against skin ageing, and Chevalier is feted by the rich and famous. Soon afterwards, however, her soldier son Hal disappears during the battle of Shahi-Kot in Paktia Province. Chevalier becomes a vocal anti-war campaigner, while Hal, with the keepsake given to him by his mother, is declared missing in action.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/they-glow-against-skin.html"},{"title":"Time, gentlemen","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    19 Dec 2003        \n        \n\nIain and Bear had bought the drinks in. This instantly brought a shower of praise from with Nigel and Jonathan (Jonathan at first resisting the call away from his laptop). Nigel promised it was his turn next, it was his turn next; Jonathan's gratitude dissolved into distraction and he turned back to the screen.\nBear shuffled off to the jukebox. He wasn't particularly ursine: in fact, he was thin and gangly, arching his way over to the console like a stop-motion figurine, the bastard brainchild of Harryhausen and Giacometti. His last name was Berry, and since primary school everyone had shortened it to Bear. For a while he had added a fey growl to his introductions, with accompanying hand gestures. He stopped after some doped-up seventeen-year-old girl with stupid eyes had laughed like a drain for a full half hour over whether Bear had had his injections or not.\nIain was talking shop with Nigel, again. A few minutes were remaining before nine o'clock, the time when the bar staff seemed to be contractually obliged to turn up the music. Conversation was soon to be squashed and pulped by the sham that The Weaver's Arms could be coated with decibels of trashy shellac, and its inhabitants thus swallow more easily the pretence that it was a club. So Iain was squeezing discussion into the remaining time. His body pumped out movements into its extremities, and he windmilled his hands if not his arms: not enough room.\n\"The thing is that the whole of the academic market, if not the public service market in general,\" he was spitting at Nigel, who was half a pint too drunk to really take it in, \"is actually easy money. I mean, I know that a lot of the schools are completely slammed for cash flow. But they're just as completely petrified of litigation. And the ones that don't give a shit about all that, I mean the government departments, you know, Whitehall and all that, not that I've had specific dealings with them but Mark Coutts at Psyentia sells to them all the time... anyway, if you tried anything like that on with them they'd laugh in your face. But they do have the cash flow so they don't mind paying up. And though they grind exceeding small they don't half grind rich. Eh?\"\nHe grinned, and Nigel just nodded. Nigel was new to the firm, and fresh out of university. It had taught him nothing at all about holding his liquor, as he had spent four of his first six terms with a committed Methodist, who seemed less committed about certain matters, the more Nigel expressed his temperance at the college bar. An encouragement if ever there was one, yet even after Yvonne had gone off with Martin---the starey-eyed, slack-jawed treasurer for the Christian Union, all predation and pizza evenings---Nigel never took to drink, harbouring instead the child's dislike of alcohol's bite. After three pints in the company of Iain (whose conversation (even when both parties were sober) was to be inhaled at one's peril, like pot fumes) Nigel felt stoned. Iain had legendary status in the company, however. Nigel hoped that someone, somewhere in the back of his head, was taking notes. But he would probably only remember it next time he was sat drunk and drooling in The Weaver's Arms. Contextual, he thought, although he had an inkling he couldn't currently spell it. If he could only take all the clients here, and revisit Iain's advice over two bottles of claret... but for business lunches it wasn't exactly Marco's, and didn't have the walk along the canal that Tasty Sam's the Chinese, or Newnham and Fleet's, had to offer.\nShaming them all, Jonathan tapped away on the laptop. Nigel couldn't take in such dedication: it seemed a little contrary in its rudeness. But then Jonathan was the departmental data monitor, their tame IT person. He wasn't built for conversation, but hid fish-eyed behind his glasses. When he spoke it was nervous and impeded.\nThe music got louder. Bear returned from the jukebox and angled himself into a seat. \"Sons of bitches,\" he spat. \"Sons of fucking bitches put bloody Bob Marley on for six or seven tracks. It showed me on the display as I was putting my ones on. No Woman No Fucking Cry is on twice. Jesus. Where's my drink? Jesus. And what are you doing, Jonathan? It's Friday night. You'd better not be working on the figures that came in from Zürich today, or I'll have to reach over there and kill you before you show us all up.\"\n\"Actually,\" he said after a few seconds, with an air of intellectualism, \"I'm writing a sh-short story.\"\nEveryone looked up from their drinks.\n\"It's ffffor a website a friend of mine in the States mmmaintains.\"\nIain's expression seemed to shift gear between different widths of grin. \"A friend in the States, eh, Jonty boy? You ever met 'em?\"\n\"Well, nnno,\" Jonathan admitted, unconcerned. \"But I sp-speak to them on IRC and ytalk, and that em-em-MSN messenger that the l-l-lamers in IT are still letting us use.\"\nNigel turned a friendly, interested, and above all hammered expression towards Jonathan. \"Wha ish itchour writinthen?\"\n\"Fffanfic. You know, based on existing stories. I'm doing a c-cross-over b-between The Matrix and Blade Runner. There's a lot of stuff about The Matrix recently. They've extended the, um, the g-gist of it all into other, um, areas.\"\n\"Narrative,\" Bear corrected. \"But I don't see why you can't inject something more interesting in there, like Jude The Obscure or the Mallory Towers novels, or Oklahoma.... Oh, never mind,\" he finished, seeing the query approaching from far behind Jonathan's goggles. There was a gap in the music, and then the syncopated sound of reggae. \"Christ, here comes Bob Marley now,\" he added with a melodramatic wince of pain. \"Anyone got a gun? I need to kill myself, after killing all of you and that twat with the hair over there in the corner that I swear put this track on.\"\n\"The screen looks funny,\" Iain said. \"What's that you're writing it in? It's all black.\"\n\"DOS. I've got an old ed-editor. I used it o-on my first PC. It's j-j-just what you're used to. B-but it only works in a DOS window.\"\nOn cue the other three all took sips from their drinks, siphoning them through similarly bemused expressions. Jonathan wasn't the sort to be writing a story, although the subject matter he had chosen lended some credulity to the idea. It wasn't something any of them had predicted. Briefly they each thought with horror that Jonathan might want them to read it.\n\"Er... is it going well, then?\"\nJonathan shook his head, and then pushed his glasses up\n\"Not-t-t-today. The thing has b-been playing up. It won't let me have the d-DOS window on the screen with Windows. I have t-to keep ssswitching. Alt-enter, you know? Alt-enter.\" He said it like it was obvious. \"Alt-enter. Like this.\" He pressed a couple of keys.\nA sudden power cut rendered the entire pub black. The wailing of the jukebox stopped, and nobody could have seen their hand in front of their face, if their hands had been there. Iain thought, typical of that idiot, no social whatsname, doesn't think twice of plugging his bloody laptop into the mains and blowing the fuses on the whole pub. But after a heartbeat the trip in the electricity supply flipped back; lights returned, and the music with it.\n\"Jesus, Mary and Gob-bloody-shite, Jonty,\" said Iain resignedly. \"The least you could do with that fucken machine is make it steam-powered, so you wouldn't have to bring down the National bloody Grid with it.\"\nJonathan looked sheepish. \"The b-b-b,\" he began to bleat, \"b-battery only lasts twenty mmmminutes. I didn't think anyone would notice.\" Putting the laptop on the cushion beside him, he rummaged around on the shelf at the back of the sofa, where the paisley cover was stapled to a long, varnished plank. He reached behind a lamp---suspiciously switched off---and pulled on the power cable as if it were a string of novelty flags emerging from a magician's assistant. It spooled onto the seat until he found the plug, and unplugged it.\nImmediately there was another blackout, as short as the first. Those who thought the first glitch had been a trick of their eyes---or their drinks---sat up in their seats, or stood up uselessly. Everyone had noticed that time, and it was only the crowds that prevented anyone from noticing Jonathan, leaning guiltily towards the power socket. With a clarity that comes rarely but vividly to the drunkard, Nigel was the first to lean over and yank Jonathan into his seat, almost bouncing him back out of it. \"Shiddown, you idjot,\" he stage-whispered, and everyone nearby could hear. Jonathan was more embarrassed now than he had ever been before, and wanted to get as far from the pub as he could: would have done, had it not been so full of people. His clumsy hands contented themselves with pulling nervously at the corners of his computer, and he moved it from the cushion to the table, in the middle of them all.\n\"Oh, great,\" groaned Iain. \"Where are we going to put our drinks now? Jonathan, shut that thing down and come and interact with some humans. Jonathan.\" He began to coax and wheedle. \"Come on, Jonathan. Lips off that little cyber-nipple now. Switch it off and come and play-hey...!\"\nJonathan began to close down his programs. \"I'll j-j-just switch off the editor, then.\" He looked up, blinked at each of his companions in turn. \"It might take a while. I'll just switch back to Windows-\"\nThe instant stretched out, Jonathan with one hand on the keyboard, the click of it sounding like a purr underneath a laughter track of pub noise. Longer, purr, longer, and then snap: it broke off, leaving that same blank darkness. Not black; maybe grey. Washed out, thought Bear, like how a television screen is so much lighter than its darkest blacks when you switch it off. And then the lights were on again, but all conversation had ceased. Rooted to the spot, each of them slid their eyes between each other's, wondering if their own were as wide with fear as everyone else's. There was a moment, and Bear noticed briefly that else in the pub seemed to be sharing it with them.\n\"Hell's bells,\" he said quietly. \"What happened then?\"\nOnly Jonathan woke up at the sound of a question. The hesitancy was still there in his voice. \"There was a delay.\" But no stutter. Just fear. Something terrible had just flashed behind those thick spectacles. \"Of course. It's because it's so old. It... didn't want to switch back to Windows. So it took longer.\"\nA pause, lights on this time. Then: \"Are you serious?\" cried Iain. \"Are you bloody serious?  Are you telling me that that bloody thing, that laptop of yours... Don't talk bollocks, Jonty. If you're trying to say that, that-\"\n\"Jesus, Iain, shut up. Whatever he's saying,\" Bear ground out through his teeth, \"I don't want to be the one to turn the damn thing off. And for Chrissake, Nigel: put your pint down somewhere else. What do we do now, then?\"\nThey sat there, with twenty minutes of battery life, wondering.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/time-gentlemen.html"},{"title":"venit","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    10 Aug 2003        \n        \n\nSo high up. On the one occasion when he had dared open a window in the office - the air condition had not been conditioning anything that day - the glass panels below him had pulled his eyes to the ground. More like a floor than a wall, the side of the building had played jokerish tricks with the directions inside his head. It had suddenly clicked for him why traders traditionally leapt out of buildings whenever the markets dived: they weren't just taking advantage of the macabre convenience; every one of them secretly wanted to do it all the time.\nAltitude and not cleanliness signifies closeness to God. Greater prestige, greater hubris: touch the sky. Now Chris was as close as he was ever likely to get, sitting in the low penthouse of the Delft building, which stood proud among the glassy denizens of the square mile of City. The inspirational paintings pattered demurely over the expanse of his office had been chosen by the chosen few who were still his superiors, and it was wisest not to take them down. Their blue hummed a beat note with the blues of the sky; the leather chairs and walnut occasionals echoed the earth far away. \nChris stared out at the clouds. The phone rang. He didn't answer it. The phone stopped ringing. He frowned in thought about what next. Then he turned off his mobile. It didn't get a chance to ring. \nIn the lower reaches of the building jobs were coloured and tagged by their function rather than their rank, and floors were numbered separately only for convenience. After ten years squeezing up and down between those laminae Chris was able to struggle up to twelve storeys below the position he occupied now. Four years of colourless middle-management had thence propelled him here, to vocations of the metallic tints: bronze, silver, and the gold that would never be his. But how much more frustrated he, and everyone else, had been down in that purgatory! The corporate rite of passage, purifying oneself into larger and larger cubicles, way stations on whose platforms one planned the rest of the journey sideways and, one hoped, eventually upwards. Once one reached the private rooms then the eternal battle was joined, where availability and likelihood of office fought perceived respectability among the finely stratified upper reaches of the company. Who would depart next for the managerial hereafter? To what sphere would they be projected? In retrospect it was no wonder that the whole of Chris's sub-department had been a long, shivering streak of anxiety and tension, humming high like a taught, plucked string. \nPitching higher than most, Chris found himself on the forty-fourth floor: a partner. Watching him land after the handshake, gasping and relieved, on his permanent perch, Chris invoked a mixture of envy and vicarious fear in Jeremy. After shadowing him through school (made men by Jesuits) and a politics-ish degree (at separate universities - Jeremy with his LSE BSc and Chris with an Oxford MA) Jeremy took the news with good, if wishful, grace. He felt relieved that he hadn't been promoted instead of Chris to what Jeremy felt to be above his own rightful place or expertise. But: \"Don't be stupid,\" Chris had once said to him. \"You could do what I'm doing.\" He didn't know himself whether it was truth or conciliation. \n\"You reckon, Chris. But you know what I'm like.\" In Chris' mind Jeremy inhaled half of his cigarette, and gesticulated as he breathed out. The smoke swirled with his hands. \"Single-minded. Head down and I can't see ver bigger picture.\" \n\"You don't reckon that's what they want?\" \n\"Nah, not really. Vey probably had one too many partners burn out by doing that. Vey need support, up there. I mean, everyone needs it, which is why I'm chasing after Jess in marketing and ayarbour a race-memory desire to fuck my secretary senseless. But up vur-\" (cigarette stabbing motion) \"-you need it more van anyone else.... How is she, by the way? You seener since ver weekend? I mean, I know it's only Tuesday, but ayafta ask.\" \nChris remembered all this as he looked at the wall opposite. Jeremy's vocal quirks that no amount of Fatherly schooling had been able to batter out of him. The grin Chris wore as he spent thirty seconds, perhaps a minute, not answering Jeremy's question. It had all happened a long time ago, for six months. Longer than the years behind and the acquired expertise: neglected depth and wasted breadth, in balance with a broken heart.\nInto his reverie passed his assistant, coughing politely through the visions of Jeremy's endless cigarette consumption, and spoke to Chris about a contract, some contract, shipping to the Hoek next month. He displayed a deference to Chris that he did not feel he deserved. Conquering kings their titles take/ from the foes they captive make/ - and Chris was forced to recognise in his PA a man that, only a year ago, had practically been his peer: recognise him and silently vomit guilt. Chris felt no longer worthy of his crown. His ego limped, like a cripple without her prop. One and one made two, and Chris felt like a half.\nHe glanced at his new toy by the south windows and then at the clock. What a view. What a view he would have.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/venit.html"},{"title":"vidit","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    18 Aug 2003        \n        \n\nIn Chris' social horizon (which was somewhat narrower than the far-off band of his spatial horizon) everyone had started meeting at dinner parties. At any rate, everyone who met everyone that does, does. The musical chairs that takes place there is no more structured or codified than the drunken spinning round each other in a club or basking in the stupid/great noise of a band at a gig. But the language is easier to learn. Pidgin Debrett's, filtered and creoled but still intact: start outwards, work inwards; pay no attention to your food; eat invisibly, and act charmingly. Truths cloaked themselves strangely at the parties Chris forced himself to attend, hidden in this language that he was only just learning. Like a foreigner or an autistic he followed the conversation at a distance, carefully trying one newly-learned trick and then another, retreating when confused or contradicted.\nEach of us when separated, having one side only, like a flat fish, is but the indenture of a man, and he is always looking for his other half.... Chris was an old enough hand at this modern equivalent of courtship that he and she were swapping significant glances across the hostess' laughter at one such gathering; six months later when Debra had recovered her strength enough to throw another do, the significance was entirely other. Chris soared, far above his forty-fourth floor. The clouds he wore, and the sky was his earth. He was happy, presumptuously happy.\nGreater height, greater prestige, greater hubris.\n\"Zeus was angry, and in his anger he cut each man in two, like a sorb apple which is halved for pickling.\"\nThe sun was round the other side of the building, yet the day was clearly glorious. Each building sang with brightness, and the air in between buzzed. Now a partner yet partnerless, Chris wanted more than anything to see beyond his dismal horizon. If only this dark vale could be lifted above the levels of his surroundings, then he might gain perspective in the stretching away of green fields and opportunities growing like wild flowers. Falling away from him like the ground, like gently-sloping hills; not steep escarpments or walls of glass. Mirrors and steel hoops surrounded him, showed him only his self alone. They pulled his eyes back to himself, dragged and dragged.\nHeight brings power and power brings opportunity. Chris had to heal himself; no healer could do it for him, bring together the skin where one had been torn into one and one. Chris was surprised at the ease with which he was able to hire investigation. It was impossible to buy facts and certainty that way, he knew; but every opportunity for facts - hurting but compassionate - was almost as precious as the fact itself.\nPhotos arrived in Manila envelopes: sporadically at first, then with a daily regularity like clock-punching. Faces that Chris would never have looked twice at were made special by the act of recorded delivery, and suspicion, however briefly, was thrown on everyone. After weeks of leafing through images of his and her acquaintances, some just hers, a message began to form among the random snaps and flashes. Like a repeated Morse code emerging from static - weakly, but then stronger once you notice it - the same face seemed to drop into Chris' in-tray more resoundingly than the rest. The accompanying notes told of increasingly intimate meetings, clinches, then definite assignations. Restaurants. Theatre. Cinema. Overnights. Curtains closed at lunchtime. It had to be him. Jeremy.\nSometimes Chris fancied he could see clues in even the early pictures of the two of them. There was the way they sat, of course, and the proximity: all the usual body bullshit. But as he stared longer at Jeremy's cigarette smoke, hanging infernally around his shoulders in every photo, and like a slipped halo over his balding head (\"Christ: what did she see in him?\") he began to pick out letters and fragments of words in the fumes. They twirled and twisted with copperplate curlicues in their lower case. Chris took a marker pen and traced out on one picture: \"tricked\". On another, \"cabron\". On yet another, \"cuckold\". When Chris received the last picture - after the closed curtains - then without consideration for the pattern of the smoke he scrawled \"YOU'RE FIRED\" over Jeremy's face. He slashed black lines through \"FIRED\" and wrote \"DEAD.\" Then he began to systematically fill the whole of the picture with black, wet ink.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/vidit.html"},{"title":"Visions and revisions","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    17 Nov 2001        \n        \n\nI stopped at the gate, one hand on the dry wood. The church stood, calmly observing me even as I frowned at it. Unable to push the gate open, I merely applied some of my weight to it. It creaked, sounding tired. Whereas the church felt like some sort of sentinel (although stood at-ease) on my immediate horizon, the gate was happy just to wait, for my decision to push or not to push, to wait for its eventual retirement and decay.\nAll of this comparison, this invocation of metaphor from my environment, was prevarication, I knew. I still could not open the gate. From a distance I looked around at the gravestones, but remained myself outside the churchyard wall. I put my hands in my pockets and waited like the gate, wondering what I might be able to force myself to do next.\nI passed through the village. It looked healthy in the dry Autumn. Leaves swelled and puffed in one final attempt to photosynthesise before their daddy trees gave up on them, cut them off from their inheritance. Houses exploded with jagged, unevenly-cut bricks, a stopped explosion with mortar padded into the cracks. The main road forked in a gentle \"Y\" and the lesser route headed up to the church and its churchyard. Up this road I walked, and stopped at the gate. Without a word, knowing that I was not particularly wanted there. I let myself be pulled back the way I came, away from the church and the graves, by a weight of indifference.\nI resolved to go up there, had been meaning to for some time. The village was beyond the eastern outskirts of the city. There is no space any more for graveyards in the centre. The only dead we have time for is those that are still moving around. A wheezy bus went to the village and back once an hour.  By the time it reached the \"please drive carefully\" sign, two girls were my only company in an echoey bus. They talked about nothing at all and stayed on when I got off at my stop, which was in the centre of the village near the monument. For all I know they stayed on all the way back, for want of something to do.\nLooking round, I swayed a little as I tried to get my bearings. I had seen the church from the A-road, and tried to find it again. It had no spire, though, was neither modern enough nor old enough to have one. After half an hour, I had made enough mistakes to know where I was going. There was a gentle gradient, and I hadn't realised the church was on a hill.\nI pushed open the complaining gate and strode purposefully on the gravel, and turned off onto the grass near the newer graves. It didn't take long to find his name, and I laid a few flowers on the stone. I paused for a few moments, trying to think myself into solemnity.\nI hadn't mentioned the flowers before. I had to be carrying flowers. I heard only a few days ago that he had died. From a mutual friend. It's strange how these things touch you. I hadn't really thought about him for years. Even when we were at school, he wasn't really part of my social group. No, that's not true. In my class for a year or two, he was: I remember. I remember because I can picture Gail, only fourteen then, turning her acidic wit on him. She etched him to the bone and I laughed.\nAnd now he has become the first in my generation to die. First of those I knew, of course. People die every day, and if they all made us stop and think then we'd get no killing done. That's what I did, though - I stopped to think. I had the sensation of the world turning under me for a brief time, as his life, the edited highlights of it that impacted on me, passed before my eyes. When I got back onto the world, I found it had turned just slightly too far without me. I wasn't in the same place I had been.\nThat's what drove me to buy those flowers, catch that bus, forget to sneer at the girls' empty conversation. I wanted to get my mind back to where it had been, to the right time zone. And all the way there I had to formulate my plan, how I would walk through the village and look at the church and.... It needed to be planned: my first grave visit as an adult. I wanted to set it in the story of my life. It was all selfishness, of course, and I knew as I approached the dry gate that all the planning was useless. Only now would I be able to see what I was going to do.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/visions-and-revisions.html"},{"title":"Wake-up call","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    11 Apr 2004        \n        \n\nHe was luxuriating, glad of the hot pounding and cold spritz of the shower's spray, when the telephone rang. Its jangling cut through the freshness, to his hangover beneath, and with a groan he pulled himself out and answered.\n\"Hello?\"\nThere was a pause before the confession: \"... Hi.\"\nHe sighed, away from the phone. Keep it light, he thought, and brightly said: \"Hi. Morning. Uh...\" (rubbed his eyes) \"... how are you?\"\n\"OK,\" the voice said, following the outline of a shrug. \"I miss you.\"\nThere was a pause as they both waited. \"Well? Say something. Say you miss me.\"\n\"I miss you,\" he admitted, rubbing a hand over his face and collecting droplets into a swipe of water. \"But...\"\n\"But.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHer turn to sigh. \"OK. Ring me? Please?\"\n\"OK.\"\nHe finished his shower but couldn't get back the hum in his skin or the way the warmth had been seeping into his bones. As he dressed he saw among the clutter on his bedside table the photograph frame turned away from the bed. He swung it round towards him for a moment, then back to the wall. Got his bag, left the house, headed towards the tube station. Tried to forget the smell of her hair: almonds and roses.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/wake-call.html"},{"title":"We put our trust","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    1 Jan 2004        \n        \n\nGeorge smelled smoke. All the time. It was a neurological condition, he would explain, inflicted upon him during a car accident he was involved in, back in 1999. He was on his way to the wedding of two friends in Wakefield, and pulled into a lay-by to check his route. Bending down to prize the road atlas from under his seat, he was propelled forward by a shunt to his back bumper. Elderly man in rusty Austin Allegro at 15mph, so minor crash had the steering column not presented itself to fontanelle. Concussion, days in hospital, missed wedding but what could you. Must remember to get present to happy couple, memory not what it what? Oh, yes please. Same again.\nNone of this story was true. Well, there was a wedding, and George did miss it. But the rest was a fabrication. Spun, tortuously, to justify George's sharp U-turn on A-road when realized had not bought present! Idiot, but lot on mind. Anyway, four years later, still no purchase. Keep intending to, but what can you say after so long?\nActually, George had indeed had an accident that day, and ended up in hospital. But was just luck that coincided with \"forgetting\"---yes, poor show, I know---to spew the requisite at Allders. Recidivist tight-arse, probably parents to blame, misplaced good intentions, scrimp and save, fine words butter no parsnips.\nThe other car had been a Citröen, not an Austin. But there had been an accident. Crushed the lovely rice steamer bought for the occasion, hundred quid from Debenhams, well you've got to for a wedding, haven't you?\nIt wasn't a car accident: minor derailment of the Bournemouth--Edinburgh train outside Bee Enn Ess.\n... Say not that none of the story was true, then, but that it lay at two extremes: the corroborated that everyone witnessed (according to the traditions of the Church of England), and the uncorroboratable related by George (according to his own traditions, ineffable and capricious). Never twice same story. And though Peter loved George like a brother, shared a history with him as a brother would, his fabrications that presented themselves as a natural progression from the facts, through history, to George's neverending alibi for living, made the man infuriating company. And an unreliable whistleblower.\nPeter sipped his coffee, decaffeinated for his nerves, and resisted the urge to scratch the itch on his shoulder. That itch was still there in his head, too: Karen hadn't been in the Globe yesterday. None of the Socialists for Democracy had appeared all night, and the barman had tugged on his beard and reacted towards most of Peter's questions about the group's whereabouts as if he had insulted Che Guevara. Again.\nThen, after a restless night and no breakfast, he had got the call from George. Shortly after leaving the house, and practically an order to meet for lunch at one-thirty and discuss \"something major.\" George was already twenty minutes late but Peter knew to give him at least another ten. He had to keep calm also, steel himself for the barrage of George's first, inevitable tale: \"why I was late for today's lunchtime appointment\", by George M Douglas. If Peter were sucked in by the first few lies then it would leave him unable to sort wheat from chaff in the story George claimed to have for him. Hush, Peter told himself. Yet despite the impotency of his drink his heart was still beating out Saint-Saëns on his ribcage./p>\nNot for the first time Peter wished for more hours in the day. He was already past his deadline for three, no four reports he was meant to be writing for different independent news portals. Ever keen to look cool, one of the nationals was close to re-employing him as a freelance, a loose cannon unafraid to take a swing at anything in need of being swung at. But he was close to losing the stripes he'd gained so far, pissing away the good will down a drain consisting of wasted evenings in the Globe trying to get stories, and wasted days filing, photocopying and doing a hundred other mindless jobs for a legal firm near Liverpool Street Station.\nOnce again, Peter's life seemed to be getting in the way of itself.\nRight, he thought, throwing his serviette onto the table and waving for the bill. Forty minutes late now, probably even a record for that lazy swine. I'll ring him later and he can come round to see me. That way at least I won't be sitting round doing sod all while I wait. He put enough money down for a feeble tip (but leaving quite a gap in his wallet) and started through the restaurant towards the door. Against the heat of summer the air conditioning breathed one last caress of coolness towards him: clean, ionized air, fighting against the city's smog.\nAs he reached the street there was a squeal of tyres from a turnoff a few hundred yards away. A dark blue saloon roared along the street, not pausing as the boot was thrown open and a bundle of clothes thrown out behind it, only to bounce and roll to a halt near the front of the restaurant. When a crowd started forming round it then Peter realized it contained a human being; a little closer and he could recognize the dress sense as being George's. He was still moving, and Peter decided that this was probably a blessing after all. As a groan creaked out of his friend, Peter stepped forward to accept responsibility for him and the trouble he had become. Under a thin veneer of calm Peter shuddered and sweated, fear crawling up his back and round his neck to throttle him with panic.

I am the thermodynamic tail that breaks free of the earth's grip. Whoof. He said: \"Oh, wow.\"\n\"That good?\" he or someone else heard Dan or someone else again say.\nStevie thought: I leap out and up, past the orbits of the planets and the clouds that surround them. Unprotected I am prodded and jostled by the sun's weak light, and after an eternity and no time at all I have passed through the universe and through the sensate.... He said: \"Yeah, pretty good. A bit... strong.\"\nDan grinned, leaned over and plucked the joint out of Stevie's limp fingers. He pulled out his cheeks, felt the heat from the flame and in his mouth, then inhaled, knocking it back with as much cool air as he could. For the first time in months Stevie was stoned. And Dan had finally made it to London. These two events were, of course, connected: Dan had brought a half-ounce of opium-soaked stock to set fire to celebrate finally getting his arse down to Stevie's. Well, Dan thought, if he would live south of the fucking river. It was a myth that taxi drivers wouldn't frequent here; it was just that they charged as much to get to Borough as they did to get to Heathrow.\nFor Dan, a night of booze and joints, and listening to their combined most-recent, was something close to heaven. He'd been worried about Stevie all night, though. Was he bored? He didn't look bored, Dan thought, wobbling his head round towards his mate and trying to focus. He looked wankered. But was he secretly bored?\nDan had grown up in a tiny village that sounded like a minor enemy of Sherlock Holmes: Marston Ruthvale, population eight hundred and seven in every ten were sheep. Every morning a bus wound its way through the village and on to the nearest big town in time for shops to open; every evening it wound its way back, sometimes.\nThe first time anyone stayed over in the town—depending on how old they looked and how deep they could bark out an order for pints, when they were around fourteen years old—they came back changed. Marston Ruthvale's adults never noticed, or pretended not to notice, but you could always tell when a mate of yours had gone up to the town. It was as though that one small leap towards a metropolitan life had stoked a fire in their heart, and that fire lit a fuse behind your eyes, a tiny pinprick of light that, once seen, you could always recognise. Kids were effectively ruined by their first trip. Evenings spent hurling abuse at each other across the cenotaph, and sometimes abusing the monuments own battered stone surfaces, seemed suddenly empty and shallow. From then on, till the day you inevitably moved away, Bali Ha'i would whisper from over the next hill but one: come to me.\nDan knew that if anyone from Marston Ruthvale had that look in their eyes, it was him. But now Stevie had moved here permanently, Dan sometimes saw that same shining star in his friend's pupils, an order of magnitude brighter. London had him in his grip: was Dan still stuck in the equivalent of drinking cider and black and kicking stones at the cenotaph?\nHow long had he been lost in thought? Had Stevie noticed? Dan cleared his throat. \"I can't believe you're living round here now, Stevie,\" he said. \"Five gigs within five minutes' walk, every night. The Lounge down the road. Giolla's open till midnight.\"\nStevie nodded. \"We used to come here every weekend we could, to get away from the shit back in Oxford. Can you blame us?\"\nMimicking himself as an undergrad, Dan squeaked, \"'What's the night-life like in Oxford?\"\nIn response Stevie quoted the college union rep: \"'Well, London's only an hour away!'\"\nThey both started laughing. Dan felt more sure of himself when they were both laughing.\n\"You should move out here too, you know. I'm serious,\" he added, as Dan began muttering a chorus of yeahs. They tailed off into silence, and Dan tried to think of something shake off the depression that was crowding round him. He thought of it.\n\"Stevie. Oi, Stevie. Dare you.\"\n\"Nnh?\"\n\"Bet you can't blag us both into The Lounge.\"\n\"What? You serious? That'd be no trouble, Danielo. Date your name.\"\n\"Tonight. Now.\"\nThere was a pause, and it stretched, and Dan thought: Christ. Stupid idea. He's changed and I've changed. We're both too bloody old, for a start, and... But Stevie's face was resisting the look of incredulity that threatened to sweep across it, and for a half-second Dan saw mischief look back at him. Finally, Stevie spoke.\n\"It's a half-hour's walk.\"\nDan shrugged. \"I'll roll us another.\"\n\"I'll be asleep by then.\"\n\"I'll do it on the way. I'm magic like that.\"\n\"I'm too spaced to stand, let alone talk my way past Fat Tony.\"\n\"We'll lean on each other.\"\n\"You're not giving me a way out, are you?\"\n\"Nope. You're gonna have to do it now, Stevie. Unless you're...\" (hands on an imaginary gunbelt, slung low over the hips, sat down so spoiling the effect) \"... chicken.\"\nStevie sighed. Then he sighed again, mouthing \"cunt\" as he did so. Then he tensed in his chair and said:\n\"First to the street.\"\nHe was up first. Dan was still untangling his legs, but Stevie had to get his keys from the mantlepiece—thank God, he thought, he was still lucid enough to remember his keys—and as he swerved between Dan and the door, he was hit by a sofa cushion that knocked him off balance. Dan leapt for the door-handle, but Stevie bounced him with a shoulder and he ended up slamming the door shut. Stevie pulled it, and Dan, aside and ran for the front door, Dan reaching out to grab the tail of Steve's jacket.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/who-dares.html"},{"title":"You are what you eat (I)","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    6 Mar 2005        \n        \n\nAmanda was first drawn to the delicatessen she passed on her way home, because she loved Christmas decorations. One of her first memories was of gazing into a bauble at herself gazing back; the reflected face was speckled by a wintry scene, picked out in raised points of white paint. Every time she conjured up the memory it would unfold behind the decoration to encompass an enormous tinsel tree (unashamedly fake), hundreds of ornaments, tiny strings of lights hung from the branches and a tiny, Barbie-perfect fairy doll so far away from her toddler hands as to be in heaven with the angels. \nFor nearly ten years, probably following that ecstatic moment, she had insisted on having fairy lights in her room all year round. Her parents had only agreed because her window looked out over fields and sheep and (usually) pouring rain; had the neighbours been able to see then the idea would have been scotched immediately. Practical right up to the moment he left, Dad had bought her a reasonably expensive set: not particularly attractive, but made for commercial use and hence unlikely to catch fire after being mauled by a romantic child. Amanda had wound them in between the hooks on the curtains, letting the two ends droop down to touch the radiator below the sill. From her bed, nestled in the corner opposite the window, she could now see a magical portal, filling every night with adventures and excitement. Every morning she woke to find they had been switched off, long after she had gone to sleep.\nThe front window of the delicatessen on Wall Street had at one time been festooned with Christmas lights, and they had never been removed. Unlike its namesake, the bombastic powerhouse, this road rarely saw any visitors. Sixty years ago it had been a route into the working-class district that had breached the old city boundaries centuries ago, and each of its shops had hummed and ker-chinged with sales. Now, as the terraces retreated and desirable residences bore down upon them, Wall Street was melancholic and lonely, fighting off the grim and empty future it sensed for itself like one might struggle with the first symptoms of a cold.\nSome recent, slim period of prosperity (or a desperate resort to the showy) had spurred the shop owner to line the inside shelf and all four sides of the frame with lights. They were unimpressive, static and primary-coloured, but Amanda didn't care. The first time she saw them, when she took a different route home from the station, she realized immediately that they were the dead spit of the set she had hung as an eight-year-old from her curtain rails. After that she walked home the same way every night, although always on the opposite side of the street, refusing to entirely sacrifice the convenience of an established route to her romantic streak.\nOne evening, with winter approaching and almost providing an excuse for the state of the shop window, Amanda looked across as she always did. Looking at the lights, especially now at the dark end of the new year and with the holidays long forgotten, made her feel like... like looking in the shop window, at any rate. She crossed over and peered in.\nBeyond the lights, it all looked rather jolly, in that way that all such establishments manage to suggest. Jars of preserves and pickles lined the shelves. A solid man with a white apron and a wide face was busy serving a customer; he lifted an equally solid block of some sort of cheese out from under Amanda's nose, and her attention followed the block back into the display. The fairy lights looped in between foodstuffs, trailed over stacks of tins and jars, and directed their warm trail away from the chilled produce. It was clearly warm inside, a hint of condensation creeping up the bottom edge of the pane of glass and clinging to the colour of the lights that shone through it.\nShe was about to look away when she noticed the piccalilli: one of the squat pyramids of jars bore, on each of its bricks, the label she remembered, perennial at the back of her sauces shelf, their sauces shelf, all those years ago. She hadn't even thought of him for months, certainly not of his eating habits; the tastebuds of a student, she'd always thought and eventually said, all spice and hidden sugar. But fancy: in amongst the Tate & Lyle and the Green & Black there was hidden a little hint of Devlin & Amanda. The idea made her want to both stay and turn away; but the scent memories, not to mention thoughts of Devlin himself and his bloody temper, pushed her from the window and broke the spell.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n              \n                    K.

It was clear from the other side of Wall Street that the display hadn't changed, and would probably have to gather dust until after Christmas. The jars of piccalilli never diminished, but then none of the piles on display seemed to. They must have been restocked during the day, she decided.\nThe year wore itself down to a solstitic nub, and suddenly it was holiday season and festive spirit. Friends in Leicester, a hundred miles away, turkey and trimmings and you could convince yourself that it snowed mid-afternoon. So some ten days passed before Amanda saw the shop again, and by that time there was a sale on. You could tell there was a sale on, not just because the rough shape of the supplies had changed (visible from the other side of the road), but by the sign saying so. Times New Roman on a sheet of A4 declared disarmingly: \"We are having a SALE.\" Amanda couldn't resist, and jogged across to the shop front.\nAs the herald of the new year the window was disappointing. It was as packed as before, but not with especially seasonal produce. The tins were more or less the same. There was an extra pile of capers in salt, tiny pods in tiny jars that looked rolled and tossed together on both levels, rather than packed with any care; any gaps were filled with uncracked walnuts; otherwise it might as well have still been September. And although the cheeses looked fine, if they were on sale then how many days were left before the brie nudged the stilton-and-cranberry and they both got up and walked out of the display in protest?\nThe back of the display had changed the most. Amanda had not seen sweets in those tall glass jars for years—she had probably simply been in too many grown-ups' shops—and the sight of them made her feel young again. Since before Christmas, the shopkeeper had positioned a legion of memories along the side counter, facing the street. Aniseed balls, Everton mints, rhubarb & custards all queued up to tell her who she had been....\n... Her sister Charlotte, a year and a half older and with hair like a roll of velvet that had been left to pour down a flight of stairs. Charlotte always used to carry the money when they were sent grocery shopping. Their mother sent them to just one of the two grocers in Brisford, the other neglected due to some historical slight or mis-purchase as dusty and forgotten as the shop's top shelves. After the bell had stopped tinkling, Charlotte had always pretended to an air of parsimony. The grocer mock-suggested all the sweets she had, finally settling on sugar letters to see Charlotte's eyes light up. Charlotte had once claimed to love them far more than her sister. Amanda in turn had decided they were her favourites too, because she always got them whatever she really wanted. Besides, she had wanted at the time, a little bit, to be her.\nNot any more, thought Amanda, and the spell was broken once again. But as she started to walk home, turning onto Pallas Way and hearing the guitarist of the band playing in the Victoria fluff a chord, she promised herself she'd ring her sister at the weekend. There was no point calling now. Charlotte would be working till three in a proverbially thankless clutter of midnight bedpans and 3am passings-away. Maybe she'd be able to catch her, hardly tired and nearly cheerful, on Saturday. Amanda would send an e-mail tonight, to find out. For the rest of her walk home and the making and taking of tea-and-ready-meal her mind was wordless, thinking only, formlessly, \"poor Charlotte.\"\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/you-are-what-you-eat-ii.html"},{"title":"You are what you eat (III)","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    19 Mar 2005        \n        \n\nShe'd never rung her sister. There was little point ringing her these days. A quick e-mail—\"on nites til sat week may be ring then? Cxx\"—or an even more garbled text would deflect conversation for another month or two. It was an ongoing game, with the last round indefinitely postponed. Who would crack first, and lose by going to visit the other? For a week or two, Amanda kept her sister's name on a mental list, but eventually it was swept away by the day-to-day and forgotten.\nWhen she next looked into the window of the delicatessen, little had changed and she had a brief flash again of Charlotte. Amanda had crossed Wall Street to avoid a tear in the pavement surrounded by tartrazine-coloured barriers.  She had gently tutted to herself at the inconvenience, but underneath she was vaguely happy for the chance to look again at what was on offer. All was in an early twilight that hid, for a moment, the fairy lights. Amanda realized with a blink that they had been switched off.\nThe shop was still having a SALE, and the theme was still a mix of salty snacks and olde worlde glass jars of crystallized food colouring, that no longer had a hold on Amanda. The days were growing longer and the dark pull of nostalgia was, she was sure, abating, melting with the early March frosts.\nThose fairy lights were off now, but was that it? Had nothing else changed? Well, someone else was pickling those capers, according to the jars: would the shopkeeper ever learn not to buy capers? The nuts had all gone, and things had been tidied up, spring-cleaned. There were also cakes made from wholegrain flour, advertised as a dietary aid, arranged like toy skyscrapers around the outskirts of the display.\nEventually, though, something else caught Amanda's eye. Miserly packaged, its colours were not bright enough to be easily noticed. Someone in marketing had made these decisions, and unwittingly had steered this flagship product into a quiet harbour. Delicatessens and curiosity shops such as this now kept the brand safe from the rough seas of consumption and commerce. It was a type of carbolic soap, wrapped in coated paper and stamped with a logo that couldn't have changed in a hundred years. It certainly was the same thirty years ago, when he'd insisted on using it, to the distraction of his wife, Amanda's mum.\n\"Daddy,\" she thought; and said, quietly.\nShe suddenly wanted to smell the soap. That would unlock him, deep inside her, and she'd feel, just briefly, like when he had dandled her on his knee, one summer in Blackpool, a fat sun shining like the face of God and ice-creams begging to be dropped on the hot tarmac of the promenade. She'd see, in her mind's eye, his face before it had any lines; before his hair had swept backwards, away from the eyes, greyed to its roots and then disappeared; before he too had gone away.\nShe pushed across the threshold into the shop, the door closing without a bell behind her. Inside was disappointing, more bare than the display had been. The big man in the apron was sweaty and impatient. She asked him for a bar of the soap and, on an impulse, a packet of flour cakes. It wouldn't hurt to return, once again, to her now tarnished New Year's resolutions. She paid: that much? Really? She tried hard not to let it show. It was worth it.\nShe hurried home with her purchases, faster now as she remembered: it was Thursday, and Grandpa would be waiting by the telephone for her to ring. God, she thought. Grandpa. Once she had kept him waiting an hour, and he'd pretended that he thought he just hadn't been able to hear the ring. \"I wasn't sure,\" he'd shouted into the receiver once, \"whether I'd been suddenly struck deaf. So I thought I'd better ring you and that way I'd know. Charlotte always rings me bang on time, you see. Bang. On. Time.\" That had been a lie, of course, unless he'd moved out of his flat into the intensive care unit, where he'd see plenty of her on the hour, every three hours.\nBut Amanda didn't need his sense of humour tonight, and the plainer and more normal the phone call (and its timing), the simpler and quicker the conversation would be, and the sooner she could put the receiver down. Maybe she wouldn't ring him at all. The old swine, he'd only put her in a mood. No, she'd go home, unwrap the carbolic soap, wash with it, and think of her daddy.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/you-are-what-you-eat-iii.html"},{"title":"You are what you eat (IV)","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    31 Mar 2005        \n        \n\nIt hadn't worked. Carbolic soap didn't smell how it used to, somehow. It was at once too pungent and too weak, sweetened with something. Probably a last-ditch effort to sell it to anyone who wasn't twice Amanda's age, she thought. Maybe it only ever smelt right on her dad. Downhearted, she finished washing her face with a squirt of something moisturising and, after a pause, dropped the soap into the bin.\nBack downstairs, she fell downhearted into a fat armchair, and reached for the chocolate box hidden under its frame. No, Amanda, she thought: be good. Leaning over she grabbed the box of flour cakes from the sofa and collapsed back again, starting the laborious, calorific task of opening all the layers of packaging.\nNothing, she was sure, was ever how you remembered it. Had they really changed their chemicals, or had she changed hers? Had carbolic soap stayed where it was, while the chemistry set of her guts had moved on? What was the point of trying to conjure people up like dreams or small gods, when all you got was plasticky paper and dry disinfectant?\nHer reverie was broken by an inward groan, a plaintive reminder from herself to herself. Grandad. Always a thankless task: he was the cheeriest soul in her whole extended family, without a tooth or a thought in his head, but he was hard work to talk to. Barely a conversation—if you could ever call them that—went by without a pitch into one of his naval stories or a yaw towards his part as a non-combatant in the great rescue at Dunkirk.\nShe nibbled again on the cake, stopped, and looked down. What was the point at which she had started thinking about her grandad? It had been in the shop, she realised. When she'd bought what was, she now saw, a packet of hard tack. Its brand name? The Merchantman's Stores, with a stylized line drawing of a wooden ship with sails unfurled, hunched against rough seas and spray. Not a nineteen-forties rustbucket by any means, but in her heart the two were close enough that she had made the leap between them without knowing it.\nShe wondered, if she mentioned anything about her biscuits to her grandad, would he tell her a story about it? Would it make sense? And would it be true? Would he even understand what she was talking about? Did that not really matter, so long as he was remembering, and she was listening? She finished the biscuit, picked up the phone, reached again for the chocolates, and dialled.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/you-are-what-you-eat-iv.html"},{"title":"You old fucking bastard","body":"\n    \n    \n            \n                    11 Dec 2000        \n        \n\nThe whole school, a thousand non-individuals, faded out obediently as she walked to the lectern. At the edge of her vision, she saw the headmaster's exopthalmic glare and realised that he was bulbously staring down the chatter. She remembered her time as a student, all the names he had been called - she had called him - behind his back. Frogger. Marty Feldman. Bog-eye. Wondering how many in the audience were secretly thinking similar nicknames and worse, she shuffled her notes on the wood. Even from a few feet away, it had the varnish smell that took her back to classrooms and chalk dust. She coughed, trying to keep it quiet but aiming it into the microphone.\n\"Most of you in the audience have probably never seen me before,\" she stammered. \"Those of you that have were almost certainly too young then to recognise me now. My names Jane Harker, and I've been asked back by Fuh-Mr Trueman to talk to you about applying to Oxford-\"\n\"No, no, no,\" croaked a voice, interrupting her. Halting abruptly, she let the whole stream of thoughts break and fizz in her mind. What on Earth? Who was that? Did she recognise the speaker? What did he think he was doing? And why, of all things, did nobody seem to acknowledge what an amazing faux pas it was to start heckling, heckling a guest speaker, for goodness' sake?\nIndeed, nobody seemed to hear the interruption at all. The faces she could make out looked expectant and slightly puzzled, apparently wondering what this odd visitor was doing, pausing mid-speech as she was. Deciding to entirely gloss over it, Jane continued.\n\"I know this school doesn't often send candidates to Oxford, but I wanted to come and let you all know that there's no harm at all in trying. Maybe if I give you a few ideas of what life is like there, and dispel some of the myths-\"\nThere was a sigh. \"God, girl. Is that really how you've been taught to speak? Project, damn it,\" croaked the same voice. This time, she caught sight of the speaker. Sitting lopsidedly and paunchily in his chair was Mr Hackett, her old English teacher. But she'd heard on the grapevine - decreasingly giggly ex-schoolgirls, all from Tatham Secondary School, mostly with families of their own now - that he'd kicked the bucket. Thank Christ, too. He was, in Jane's opinion, a misogynist prat. \"You're not talking to your squeaky chums now, girl,\" he croaked out, almost reading her mind.\nWhat was going on? Why was nobody else reacting to this? At worst she'd expect a laugh or two, a reaction against her. But nothing. There he was, though, sat next to a few year 11's, one of them brushing against him. Large as life, and making her remember all her antagonism for the old fart.\n\"In my first week in Oxford, I remember that I felt completely out of my depth-\"\n\"Useless,\" came the interruption. \"Useless girl. Speak from your Ab Doe Men,\" he enunciated, talking as if to an imbecile. \"I'd like to think, just once, that all my life hasn't been wasted on teaching you idiots to no avail.\"\nShe fidgeted on the stage, not knowing where to look or what to do or say next. Nothing in her life or in her world of actions and reactions had prepared her for this.\nIn a rented flat in London, she thrashed and thrashed against her bedclothes, sweating a storm, a sea, a pillar of salt. Her teeth ground and her eyelids twitched. But she wouldn't wake up yet. No, not yet. Her mind was not at all finished with itself yet, resolving its past failings and omissions and \"what ifs?\" It was to be a long night. Next there was Cross Country, she thought with a perverse entwining of love and loathing. After that. After that. After that was Naked Fashion Parade.\n\n    \n            \n                    J-P Stacey        \n        \n\n  ","href":"article/you-old-fucking-bastard.html"},{"title":"C. R.

What's interesting is that it's particularly suited to Latinization, because the original words are pretty much all of Old, or at least Middle, English origin.

Thirlwell mentions that the respected translator passed away in March, and he regrets never having a chance to meet her.\nMost people won't have heard of Barbara Wright, although to longstanding readers of QlL her name might ring a bell. She translated many of Raymond Queneau's works into , most notably Exercices en Style. Indeed, it was her version—a present from Richard—which inspired me to begin my own pet project, Exercises in Song. For that reason, I'm more than a little ashamed that I missed the many glowing obituaries that appeared at the time.\nI'd rather hoped when I began to plan Exercises in Song some twelve months ago that I might be able to meet her, or even interest her in the project. Then, as time went on, I decided it was probably best to let what was almost certainly a frail old women be. The right decision, of course—who at her age would want me fawning at them?—but I now feel considerably sadder that I can no longer even entertain the possibility. By all accounts Wright was as great a raconteur as a translator, and probably not at all as frail as I'd imagined, and I regret passing up even a slim chance to have come to her attention.\nThere's some comfort in the fact that the replacement edition of Exercises in Style waiting for me at the local bookshop—my current copy is decidedly over-thumbed—comprises Wright's last work. Her translations of Queneau's originals are a joy to read: literally, as you feel her own enjoyment of the work glowing on every page. So in some way I hope that, by reading her translations as closely as I can—as closely as I must—I may yet through the text meet her and shake her hand.

If you've heard of him, you've probably read him; if you haven't heard of him, then you might never have done so were it not for this blogpost. People who read doorstep thrillers read him in their millions, but you're unlikely to stumble across him if you prefer chick-lit or Bohumil Hrabal.\nLet me say right now that the book—The Vanished Man—was very compelling, a real page-turner. I read it from cover to cover in a couple of days, while also spending my last day of the holiday with family and travelling on four separate trains. It was consumable and wanting to be consumed, much like the Harry Potter series. Although, come to think of it, the twists and turns at the end were surprisingly flat: maybe the point is that they'll read better on the big screen. \nThe dialogue is generally fairly believable, and it's that which brings characters to life. But the quality of the rest of the prose... oh, my. Most of it reads as though a very literate but excitable teenager had been asked to sit down with a straight-to-DVD thriller and a fresh pot of percolated coffee and then transcribe everything that happens. \nYou get a lot of suddenly explanatory paragraphs, which try to fill you in with \"he had to do X because you see Y was a Z and A, B and C which happened ages ago meant that D was impossible for Y\"; meanwhile, technical descriptions of exactly what protective suits do, and exactly how particular bits of evidence were bagged wrongly, jostle for space with the plot; and the narrative voice tends to veer towards vocal sympathy with whoever has just been talking or acting in each scene, like a sort of leaky, empathic, internal monologue. \nThe evidence seems to be all that matters: it drives the change of scene, the lingering or hurrying of narrative, and in fact the plot as a whole. In small doses that would be understandable in a book about forensic pathology, but the relentless concentration on forensic methods and results, and the history and provenance of every detail, and how you work out histories and provenances of details, makes the whole thing read like fact porn.\nIt sounds awful, but I read it in its entirety: so does it even matter? Why am I bothering to complain? Well, Jeffrey Deaver is a rich and successful chap: people like his books; buy, read and recommend his books. And others then read them too. But the same could be said of Conan Doyle, yet his books are still very popular indeed some eighty to a hundred years after they were written. \nAnd maybe that longevity isn't essential to a doorstep novel, but: wouldn't it just be a bit nicer if your book might last a hundred years rather than ten, while still earning you a similar wodge of cash? Not only that, but I was frequently tempted to throw the book from me as hard as possible. How many people put down a Deaver novel because of its terrible writing?\nHere's a bit of Deaver's prose from early on in the novel. I've marked with obelisks the points at which I was tempted to throw the book off the balcony.\n\nChapter 2\n'He's listening to music.'\n'I'm not listening to music. The music happens to be on. That's all.'\n'Music, huh?' Lon Sellitto muttered as he walked into Lincoln Rhyme's bedroom. 'That's a coincidence.'\n'He's developed a taste for jazz,' Thom explained to the paunchy detective. 'Surprised me, I have to tell you.'\n'As I said,' Lincoln Rhyme continued petulantly, 'I'm working and the music happens to be playing in the background. What do you mean, coincidence?'\nNodding at the flat-screen monitor in front of Rhyme's Flexicair bed, the slim, young aide, dressed in a white shirt, tan slacks and solid purple tie, said, 'No, he's not working. Unless staring at the same page for an hour is work. He wouldn't let me get away with work like that.'\n'Command, turn page.' The computer recognized Rhyme's voice and obeyed his order, slapping a new page of Forensic Science Review onto the monitor. He asked Thom acerbically, 'Say, you want to quiz me on what I've been staring at? The composition of the top five exotic toxins found in recent terrorist laboratories in Europe? And how 'bout we put some money on the answers?†'\n'No, we have other things to do,' the aide replied, referring to the various bodily functions that caregivers must attend to several times a day when their patients are quadriplegics like Lincoln Rhyme†.\n'We'll get to that in a few minutes,' the criminalist said, enjoying a particularly energetic trumpet riff.\n'We'll get to that now. If you'll excuse us for a moment, Lon.'\n'Yeah, sure.' Large, rumpled Sellitto stepped into the corridor outside the second-floor bedroom of Rhyme's Central Park West town house†. He closed the door.\nAs Thom expertly† performed his duties Lincoln Rhyme listened to the music and wondered: coincidence?'\n\nThis still reads so badly to me that parts of it make me giggle a bit. I was originally thinking of going through the whole excerpt line by line and explaining precisely why; I'd love to annotate the bits that clunk, the bits that boing, the bits that shudder almost as if they want to rattle themselves to pieces in sheer linguistic embarrassment; but instead I want to just go ahead and try to fix it.\nFor any novel you can propose a fictive narrator: as opposed to a fictional one, which you would get in first-person writing. No character ever meets the fictive narrator, and he never enters any scene. But if he doesn't actually see all (the omniscient narrator is another argument to be had), he nonetheless sees something, and then broadly tries to relate that to the reader. How accurately he does that, and in what phrases and terminology, defines the \"voice\" of the narration.\nIf his job is to say what's happening when and where, he can also, at a stretch, say what people are thinking. But it's far more powerful if he says what people look like while they're thinking, and leave it to the reader to work it out. And if he has to pass a value judgment on some broad generalisation of current events—describing someone as \"expertly perform[ing]\" something when it really describes nothing—then he's basically writing like that caffeine-raddled teenager I imagined earlier, busy explaining what he totally thought was happening when that bad dude did that thing just then.\nRaymond Chandler wrote most powerfully when his narrator was at his least omniscient, and that's why he was very good indeed at first-person prose. His fictional narrator always seemed a bit dumb compared to everyone else: often he'd do all sorts of thrillerish things—watch houses, discover guns, drive cars—without once giving the reader an opinion. You learnt his opinions from his conversations with other people; better, you inferred them from his tone when he had those conversations. All the objectivity was explicit, yet at the same time the subjectivity were all implicit. Such a principle ought to suit the genre of fact porn admirably.\n\nChapter 2\n'He's listening to music,' Thom said over his shoulder. Following him along the landing was Detective Lon Sellitto. Thom was smart, young and slim, dressed in a white shirt, tan slacks and solid-purple tie; Sellitto was paunchy and rumpled, like he had swollen up once but then started to deflate.\nAs they both walked towards an open bedroom door, a voice came from inside. 'I'm not listening to music,' it said. 'The music happens to be on. That's all.'\nSellitto entered the room and saw Lincoln Rhyme on his Flexicair bed. A flat-screen monitor hovered within Rhyme's vision, off to one side. Sellitto and Thom both stopped by the foot of the bed.\n'Music, huh?' Sellitto muttered. 'That's a coincidence.'\n'He's developed a taste for jazz,' Thom said to Sellitto in a stage whisper, grinning crookedly. 'Surprised me, I have to tell you.'\n'As I said,' Rhyme interrupted, 'the music happens to be playing in the background. I happen to be working. What do you mean, coincidence?'\n'He's not working,' Thom countered. 'Unless staring at the same page for an hour is work. He wouldn't let me get away with work like that.'\nRhyme looked blackly at Thom, then back at the monitor. 'Command, turn page,' he barked, firing the words out much like someone else might peck at computer keys. The monitor suddenly displayed something new; Sellitto couldn't see what.\n'Say, Thom,' he said acerbically, 'you want to quiz me on what I've been staring at? Only the composition of the top five exotic toxins found in recent terrorist laboratories in Europe. How 'bout we put some money on the answers?'\n'No, we have other things to do,' the aide replied, looking steadily at Rhyme.\nRhyme's gaze bounced incredulously from Thom to Sellitto and back. His head moved, but no other part of his body had yet done so. 'Sellitto's just got here, Thom. You have got to be shitting me.'\nThom smiled again. 'Not quite that, but close. Hey, you asked me not to disturb you earlier. So now we're late sorting you out. So now we sort you out.'\nThe jazz played a particularly energetic trumpet riff. Rhyme listened to it with half an ear. 'In a few minutes, Thom. Give a cripple a break. Sellitto wants to talk to me.'\n'Right now, I'm afraid,' Thom emphasised. Turning to Sellitto, he said with a slight bow: 'If you'll excuse us for a moment, Lon.'\n'Yeah, sure.' Sellitto drifted back out onto the landing like an untethered balloon. As the door closed behind him, he heard Rhyme repeat loudly: \"Coincidence, Lon?\" But Sellitto moved on, as if blown as if by an invisible breeze, to the end of the long corridor. Not listening to anything at all, he looked out of the second-floor window instead, at the busy width of Central Park West below.\n\nIt's only a first draft, and this particular bit is longer than I like, but I hope it shows is what happens when the narrative tone is made more consistent, and some breathing space provided between the explicit and implicit. The dialogue is almost untouched, yet the scene feels to me far more real than before. And if Deaver has one eye on the film adaptation (as all thriller writers must surely do these days) then this scene now feels more cinematic, more \"camera-shot\", than it did before.\nI'm no professional writer. I'm certainly not as successful as Jeffrey Deaver and I don't have his ideas or his commitment. But if he ever wants someone to do some sub-editing for the sake of posterity and longevity, I'm up for it.\n  ","href":"blog/does-good-writing-matter-doorstep-novel.html"},{"title":"Don't be gridiculous","body":"\n    Speaking of ten-by-ten grids and synchronous short stories, back in February I had the idea of writing a story in a hundred different ways, a hundred words each. Yes, I think about this sort of thing all the time.\nI called the project 10x10x100, and each hundred words was going to tell some aspect of the same ten seconds of time. There would be ten different styles and ten different locations, and the reader wouldn't know for some time (a) what the story was about and (b) how it would resolve. I got around eleven stories into it and then started scratching my head about how to continue. It needed some core energy that I just couldn't develop and harness, so I took a rest from it—pretty disconsolate, to be honest, as I had no other ideas for A Pocketful of Lies #3 at that time—and started casting around for other ideas.\nIt's still on the back burner, and I think I could see how to finish it if I returned to it now, but as you've probably guessed by now it's not what I'm doing this Christmas.

No easy task given some of the horrors I have yet to write, but it will at least give me something to work towards. \nOnce those are done, I will start writing extra exercises, probably in the new year. Alongside the 99 Queneau originals, I hope to include: 9 based on other literary works (we already have, of course, exercises based on The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and A Christmas Carol); 3 retellings of the original Queneauvist story; and possibly 1. There's a pleasing if largely ornamental symmetry in those numbers that make them feel right.\nUltimately I'd like to be one of the top few Google hits for the more obscure rhetorical terms like metathesis, but I'll be glad to make availale all 99 Queneau variations, and over the moon if I finish the other 13.\nIf you enjoy word play, Greek rhetoric and silly songs, then you're more or less guaranteed a steady trickle from our dedicated RSS feed, so feel free to subcribe to it in your favourite RSS reader or via something like Facebook or LiveJournal.\nLife is too short, and too precious, to keep anything creative which you might ultimately feel proud of in your mental, metaphorical or literal attic.

Over the course of six months I wrote some sixty variations on the theme of an old English folk song, as an homage to the Oulipo co-founder Raymond Queneau. By Christmas I had enough material to publish a compilation of twenty-five of these, and published them as both a print-edition Pocketful of Lies and an online advent calendar in time for Christmas 2008.\nAfter that, I largely dropped the project. Apart from a couple of new exercices, I wrote nothing more in 2009. The time consumed buying our first house certainly contributed to this lack of creative output, but it's also clear that I'm not one of nature's finishers. It was always at the back of my mind that the project was unfinished, and melancholy for that very reason. Half a success still feels like a failure.\nThree events have prompted me to return to the Exercises in Song. The first was when Barbara Wright, translator of the original Exercices en Style, passed away in June last year. I had considered contacting her about my own work, but had never grasped that particular nettle; now it was too late. The second was the death of a close college friend late last year, which---and I'm sure every untimely bereavement provokes these feelings---brought home to me how few chances we have to fulfil even our smaller and more mediocre dreams.\nThe final event was at a protest march a few weeks ago, when I was asked to write an impromptu song and managed to produce one. Someone suggested I should do a variation on \"Show Me The Way To Go Home\", and for half a second I wondered: \"why on earth would I choose that?\" It still surprises me that, in my head and heart, I had ceased to have ownership of the Exercises in Song and the folk song which underpins all of them. I felt sufficiently guilty for having shelved the project indefinitely, and sufficiently sad that I might never have the urge to finish it, that I had pushed all recollection of the exercises out of my mind.\nSorry, Exercises; sorry, M. Queneau; sorry, Ms Wright: I've betrayed you all, in a small but significant way. But things are changing round here, and the Exercises in Song will be finished, and published, before too long.

It was a bit complicated stylistically, but I think it worked all right. You might want to read it now, if you're planning to ever do so, as I'm about to discuss it in detail.\nIt focused on what might be called a distant bereavement, and was inspired by hearing about two separate deaths: that of a brief co-worker, discovered some time after we worked together; and that of someone I knew in passing at school. These were far away in time and (social) space respectively, which gave me breathing space in which to insert a narrator. The resulting story wasn't so much about heavy intimations of mortality themselves, as about the lighter intellectualizing we employ to deal with being confronted by them.\nOne old man who had died many months before I found out; one young man I had barely known, but who had represented at the time the vicious swipe of that barbed statistical long tail across my still-youthful generation. Remote, unlikely occurrences, given weight by the subject matter. But they were still easier to write about, combined, than the weekend just gone.\nSomething awful has happened: a good friend had died a month previously, and I hardly even knew he was ill until Saturday (I'd heard he was get-well-soon sick, but not much more.) That I can't really write about him yet, or about the suddenness of knowing about his death, about missing his death like missing a train, is only seemly and to be expected. But what's agony is that the ghoul in me wants to write about it---pages and pages---when I can't; to simultaneously unburden myself and also act out a rather grim writerly performance. On the one hand I want to offer up my verbalizing in the crucible of the internet---where most of my life presents itself these days in one aspect or another---while on the other I seek nothing but quiet mourning.\nThis is the quandary of loss in our hyperconnected, uniquely literate age: that there are a million places we can write almost whatever we want; but nowhere, no cultural or technological space, in which we can howl like a wounded bear. This is the agony of modern grief.\n  ","href":"blog/ghoul-me.html"},{"title":"How Queneau took over","body":"\n    In April 2008 I was starting to think about a new project, for Christmas that year. It was something along the lines of 10x10x100, although the exact details are difficult to remember.\nI know I'd been given Queaneau's Exercises in Style (in translation, obviously) as a birthday present by my friend Richard. It had struck a chord: the twin notions of working in miniature and working in small multiples have always been important to me; the Exercises encapsulated both. And so, my head full of ideas, I took the book on holiday to Spain for what I think was my mother's 60th birthday party.\nAt the party I was co-opted to play the guitar. I rarely play the guitar these days, and I'm really quite badly out of practice. But that hardly seemed to matter, and I was far more of a hit than I expected or indeed deserved. But one of the songs I didn't accompany - but which people sang among themselves - was a version of Show Me The Way To Go Home, rewritten with circumlotionary synonyms dropped in place of original words. You'll have heard it: it's all very Latinate and ornate, somewhere in the orbits of Precious and Noble. We all eventually escaped into the night and soon after - possibly that very evening as we walked away from the pensionistas club on the sea front - I mentioned to K. that I had an urge to do something similar.\nI liked the idea of variations on a theme - two or three different versions had been sung in sequence - coupled with something folky and unpretentious; there might be fun to be had in the juxtaposition of a high-concept Oulipian idea with an old music-hall tune. The original has basically become a piece of lacquered folk music: even those who sing it in pubs, sing it half-jokingly these days; meanwhile, pop culture continues to refer to it and re-hash it, either affectionately or with a studied archness.\nSomething clicked, then. Here was a structure, handed to me by Queneau - who almost certainly had no particular plan when he began his own variations - into which I could fit my own work. Here was a vindication of my own wish to construct the small multiple, that not only could it work to produce something which might approach (however remotely) literature, but that it could be something which my parents' friends, consisting largely of not-at-all bookish ex-pats, might appreciate.\nAt that point, Queneau took over all my existing, completely. It sounds like such a silly idea, even now; but it utterly supplanted everything else I had been thinking of. And later, the misery of being 2/3 through but running out of steam: that blocked all other work too. Only on finishing it, boxing it up, exorcising it: only then have I been able to get back to 10x10x100.\n  ","href":"blog/how-queneau-took-over.html"},{"title":"Infinitarian's exercise","body":"\n    Owing to Christmas and minor illness, I completely neglected to respond to Phil Purser-Hallard's very kind discussion of Exercises in Song on his blog.

I'll let you know when that happens.\n  ","href":"blog/non-fiction-writing-january.html"},{"title":"NoNoNoMo","body":"\n    I've been trying to take part in National November Writing Month (or NaNoWriMo) this year. I think it's fair to say the results are mixed.\nThe biggest discouragement for me is that the length you're meant to have written is fixed at 50,000 words in the month; or 1666 words per day. That's the standard measurement of the modern novel, in case you haven't been subscribed to Proceedings Of Writers With Eighty-Column Minds recently. Now, those who know that my current project is called 10x10x100 will be able to guess that my word count is actually going to be somewhere in the region of 10,000. Even with the many thousands of preparation I've already written, I'll never make 50,000 by the end. So what use is the website, and its community, to me; while all the time I'll have a discouraging tally glaring at me from my profile?\nBut more generally I've found the procedure fairly disheartening. Obviously the whole point of setting some kind of limit is that I'm meant to have all of this written by the end of the month and feel spurred on when I'm getting behind; but after an initial spurt, and two more scattered evenings of work, I've frankly ground to a halt. Which would be fine, except the artificial deadline of NaNoWriMo makes me feel like at 2000 words instead of the 4200 I wanted to have written by day 14, I've already fallen far too far behind and really ought to give up. The whole thing feels like working at a steady and unceasing pace I'm just not interested in, that my timetable simply cannot support.\nMaybe if I weren't working towards such a fixed- and low-quantity, and fixed- and formalized-quality, goal; maybe if I had more time in November, and I never have spare time in November; maybe if I weren't sidetracked by a visit from my parents, my grandfather's birthday and the encroachment of the Christmas season, which I genuinely and wholeheartedly adore; maybe then I'd enjoy NaNoWriMo more. As it is, it's got me wishing for December even more than usual.\n  ","href":"blog/nononomo.html"},{"title":"Other ninety-nines","body":"\n    Having read the translation of Queneau's Exercises in Style (and before I found the original French), I wondered if the notion of taking a single histoire and \"retemplating\" it in such a large number of ways within the same work had been used anywhere else. Queneau was a founding member of the French Oulipo, a hugely influential school even now, but I wanted to know if his own work rather than that of the Oulipo had been carried forwards.\nI was already acquainted with the fact that B S Johnson had cheerily, brilliantly experimented with something like retemplating, as part of his attempt to explode the Victorian-narrative novel. House Mother Normal remains shocking and a bit horrifying in its conclusions, while pushing the boundaries of what the novel form can do. As in Exercises, the novel consists of the retelling of the same set of events in an old people's home by the occupants, where each page counts for a minute—for the same minute—of the story from their point of view, and white space is made to stand for their mental absence: the inner monologues of the Alzheimer's sufferers are heartbreaking in their blankness. Still, Johnson was arguably working in the tradition of James Joyce, parallel to Queneau rather than following in his footsteps.\nGeorges Perec was more obviously a devotee of Queneau, and so maybe a more likely starting point for a \"Queneauvist school.\" His magnum opus Life A User's Manual certainly has the flavour of variation, or at any rate accretion: the story is told by each chapter listing, often quite plainly, the items in a single room of an apartment block, along with their backstory. When we look deeper, we see even closer correspondences: Perec chose the order of the chapters by zig-zagging around a map of the apartment block in a \"knight's tour\", mimicking the movement of that particular chesspiece on a board. And by missing out a single square in a ten-by-ten grid of rooms, he wrote: ninety-nine chapters.\nOnline, I found Matt Madden's excellent 99 Ways to Tell a Story relatively quickly (thanks to Andrew who pointed me in the right direction). Madden has applied the general thesis of retemplating, taken directly from Queneau, to the notion of the graphic novel: how to retell the same basic story in cartoon form many times. Along the way he (probably necessarily) discarded Queneau's own list of rhetorical templates in favour of his own choice of graphical representations.\nAnd of course I also found anything else you could get from Wikipedia and Google, including a few other Oulipian resources such as Perec's Le Grande Palindrome. I blagged a copy of the Oulipo Compendium (again, from Andrew). But otherwise, I largely drew a Johnsonian blank. Maybe as you'd expect.\nIf you wanted to delineate an obvious school of Joycean thought in literature, then despite Joyce's groundbreaking and influential work it would probably only really contain a handful of people like Johnson, Flann O'Brien, maybe Anthony Burgess. Even David Mitchell's experimentation in Cloud Atlas pales in comparison with the master's efforts. Similarly, I found that the school of Queneauvist—as opposed to Oulipian—writing was relatively small. Maybe that's because Queneau was really picking up on an existing and fairly simple method of producing art, that of the variation of a theme; maybe it's because the notion of variation, like a lot of Joyce's motifs, came from music rather than literature, and therefore just didn't find fertile ground; maybe there's only so much you can do in ninety-nine steps.\n  ","href":"blog/other-ninety-nines.html"},{"title":"Pacing myself","body":"\n    Since I decided to explain the third Pocketful of Lies in a blog format, I've started getting itchy. I'm basically trying to summarize six months of research over about ten days, until the first article is published, and it's hard to either not to get ahead of myself.\nBlogging isn't suited to that level of pre-planning, either. Each blogpost can and indeed ought to be well written, to a level depending on the context, but the cycle of posts as a whole should really be an accretion. It works well: a corpus of knowledge, the enyclopædic equivalent of a folksonomy, with the order springing from the content and how the author puts it together. But I'm trying to gradually build to a conclusion, or at any rate to a handing-off of the creative work to.... Ah, not yet.\nI've no idea if I'll carry on blogging here in 2009, given the number of other outlets I have for writing, but I hope so. Blogging, proper blogging, is easier than always having to work out how to say next what you're going to say next, which is what I'm currently trying to do.

Despite in no way hitting everyone else's target of 50,000 words, or even managing to land within the outer circle of 10,000 words (which was my own personal target) I've still composed... well, 3,000 words, or 30% of what I had hoped to achieve.\nAfter an initially slow start, I was productive for perhaps a week or two, until my efforts were entirely derailed by over a week spent with my parents. As I don't get to see them that often, I didn't have the option of telling them to give their darling little author some peace and quiet while he composed his thing of beauty.

Other famous Oulipians include Georges Perec and Italo Calvino. \nThe society's guiding principles involved placing apparently arbitrary and frequently mathematical, lexical or logical constraints on a piece of work. These constraints might paradoxically \"free\" the creative spirit behind the work, leading to avant-garde inventiveness in its production. Indeed, unlike many other schools, Oulipo considered creativity to be very much an exercise in planned production.\n\n  ","href":"blog/queneau-and-oulipo.html"},{"title":"Raymond Queneau's 99 stories","body":"\n    In 1947, French author and Renaissance man Dr Raymond Queneau wrote the groundbreaking Exercices en Style. It's rather hard to explain while retaining its magic, but Queneau retold the same —frankly banal—story ninety-nine times. Each time he used a different rhetorical style or viewpoint. These ranged from abstruse methods like polyptotes, through logical analysis and highfalutin styles, to intentionally silly decompositions such as telling the entire story through exclamations. Bof!\nBarbara Wright translated the work as Exercises in Style some eleven years after its publication. Her translation remains the definitive English version, and utilizes almost all of Queneau's original styles in composing the exercises.\nMy friend Richard very kindly bought me the English translation by Barbara Wright, Exercises in Style, for my birthday this year, back in April. I devoured it, of course.

Too much effort was going into the form, and the content was suffering. What I really wanted was a balance, both in form and content: each would need to be unusual in some way, unexpected in context; but each would need to stem in part from some existing work. I went to Spain to see my Mum for her 60th birthday, and took my laptop with me.\nMum and Dad have fallen in with a good crowd in their little Spanish town. Spanish, German and British pensioners all come together at the Pensionista club every few days, and that was where Mum decided to have her birthday. It was lovely, right up to the point where Mum wanted me to start playing Beatles songs on the guitar. This was the culmination of about an hour of singalong, and only lasted about half an hour, so I can't really complain.\nEarlier on, though, they sang a drinking song which you've probably heard. It's actually an old English folk song: Show Me The Way To Go Home. James Campbell and Reginald Connelly popularized it in 1925—this is all unashamedly from Wikipedia—and these days it's occasonally popular, in a pre-WWII music-hall medley style. Wikipedia, with its usual gift for a lepidopterous impaling of every twitching leg of fact, charts its ups and downs in popular culture.\nBecause of its demotic audience—and demotic performers—a few versions of Show Me... exist. The most frequently sung one, which was also on the song sheet for my Mum's birthday, and also on Wikipedia, is a Latinization of the original. They're generally a bit daft, and make me cringe a bit: I have an aversion from ideas if they're half-baked, however good. But these things do the rounds on email forwards between the post-Facebook generation and they're fun enough in themselves.\nIt was only on the way home, dizzy with drink, chattering away to my wife, when it suddenly hit me. \nVersions. \nVariations. \nExercises. \nNinety-nine exercises, based on the same simple song.\nExercises, in song. \nAnd that was it. \n  ","href":"blog/singing-drinking-songs-my-parents.html"},{"title":"Small multiple is beautiful","body":"\n    One of the most striking portraits I have ever seen is a miniature of John Hurt, on (I think temporary) display at the National Portrait Gallery some time back. Stuart Pearson Wright painted it on a piece of wood smaller than a drinks coaster, with tiny flecks of the finest of brush standing in for each of Hurt's wiry bristles. Photographs of it such as this one don't really do it justice, as they frequently appear on monitors and in print at a size far greater than the original. As with Rothko paintings at the other end of the scale, the size is the point.\nWorking in miniature is something that fascinates me—hence maintaining a short-story site—but I've also become interested in variation recently. It's a standard method of translating genius into art in classical music, to take a single theme and to produce variations on it within a strict theoretical framework, but it's used less often in other genres. B S Johnson was a master of it, writing House Mother Normal by retelling the same story from the viewpoints of all the residents of an old people's home, in order of gradually decreasing mental capacity, with each page lasting the same length of time in the story (leading to a lot of blank spaces, literal \"vacancies\"). \n On the web, the now sadly defunct Harpold 500 was an excellent combination of writer's block-buster and formal constraint: 500 words every few days on any topic, as a coherent work of writing. NaNoWriMo, when it's used properly (as opposed to simply as a mechanism for generating wordcounts) can produce some excellent work, but there's a lot more dross to wade through there.\nVariation's something I'll return to, along with a discussion of the elephant in the room of variations, the clever French doctor not mentioned here, at a later date, as it's behind this year's in-progress Pocketful of Lies.\n  ","href":"blog/small-multiple-beautiful.html"},{"title":"Spoiler alert!","body":"\n    I finally posted all print copies of Exercises in Song 2008.

Three, if you include \"cream-crackered\". In fact, now I read it again, I realise it's a veritable cuss-fest from end to end.\nRhyming slang permitted me to translate an otherwise straightforward retelling of the core story into something immediately flowery and melodramatic. It's a bit like polari or some other cant, in that it carries with it a flavour of cheekiness and, even fainter, not-quite-legality. If you translated each instance back through its  derivation to the literal meaning, then... first of all it wouldn't rhyme (because a lot of rhyming slang is about obscuring the original rhyme), but also it would be pretty flat in comparison.\nConcentrating on getting juicy slang phrases in there also meant I could avoid pantomiming the Cockney accent that it's usually delivered in.

Indeed, its melody is likely to be an English or Irish folk tune. My family sang it in this spirit, with little care for accuracy of words or—depending on who was singing—pitch.\nWhen I began this project in 2007–8, I therefore consulted online commentators (I confess: Wikipedia) and found my original suspicions confirmed: the song as a whole was considered as folk. I felt this gave me carte blanche to continue working, happy and carefree.\nSince then, and at the time of publication of this edition, I’ve been made aware of a copyright claim, at least on the lyrics, arising from the 1925 composition by James Campbell and Reginald Connelly, under the pseudonym Irving King. I am obliged to respect this and—especially since that songwriting duo did so much to popularize the song—do not reprint their version here.\nThe original’s folksiness—if not strictly folk—means it has ironically acquired variations of its own. I therefore chose as a template the variant from my youth; an arbitrary decision, but one which hopefully improves the effect of intentional variations made for the purposes of these exercises. Compared to what I believe to be the Irving King lyrics, my template differs in (at least) the following:\n\nFourth line begins: And it’s gone…\nFifth line begins: No matter where…\nSixth line begins: Over land…\nSeventh line begins: You will always…\n\nThere are doubtless variants available online which match this template; perhaps in a future edition I will be able to include it. For now, I won’t judge you if you jot it down—in pencil!—on the inside cover of your copy of the book.\nMost of the exercises which follow can be sung to the same (folk) tune as my template, and usually with the same rhythm too: even Free Verse, Telegraphic, the spoken words of Opera English, and Haiku; the last tries to carry the tune, if not the rhythm. Necessary exceptions include Ode—which can be sung to the tune of Gilly Gilly Ossenfeffer Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea—and Sonnet and Alexandrines—either of which readers are welcome to sing however they wish: but perhaps quietly, or at any rate indoors.\n  ","href":"exercise/show-me-way-go-home.html"},{"title":"Sonnet","body":"\n    Though I still exercise myself with such\nHeartfelt requests for you to guide me home,\nThey only serve to tell you just how much\nI treasure my soft bed, some time alone.\nThe social animal will oft retreat\nInto his cave; so likewise I would fain\nCease travelling, and thus protect my feet;\nCease revelling, and thus protect my brain.\nBut neither can I do; rather, condemned\nTo walk o’er land, and sea, and foam betimes,\nI seek my only solace in each friend\nI meet and entertain with meagre rhymes.\nTo recap: show me home, is what I mean;\nAnd what once took eight lines now spans fourteen.\n  ","href":"exercise/sonnet.html"},{"title":"Speaking personally ","body":"\n    Listen, between you and me,\nI want to go home: is that so bad?\nI really couldn’t care if it’s now happy hour,\nAfter all the booze I’ve had.\nWell, in all honesty,\nThere’s nowhere I’d rather be,\nThan all warm and comfy, tucked up in bed:\nJust speaking personally.\n  ","href":"exercise/speaking-personally.html"},{"title":"Spectral ","body":"\n    Long after yonder inn closed,The quiet was shattered by a groan!A ghostly figure, head in hands, appeared to me,Crying: \"show me the way home!\"\nThis fearful, tortured shadeFinally began to fade,Calling \"rest!

This is Exercises in Song, and you can order a print copy of selected Exercises now, for free. \nThe core set of 99 variations are modelled after the seminal 1947 literary masterpiece by Raymond Queneau, Exercices de Style. Whereas Queneau told many variations of the same everyday story, Exercises in Song elaborates upon the eight lines of Show Me The Way To Go Home. Each variation is performable to the melody of the original folk song, and Exercises in Song also includes new variations, not seen in Queaneau's work: from ninety-nine core variations; to nine re-rendering of classics of English literature in the Show Me... format; to three retellings of Queneau's original story in song. \nExercises in Song 2008, the third Pocketful of Lies, is a sample of the best of both the original ninety-nine and the new twelve variations, finishing on December 25 with a special, Christmassy variation. \nSing an Exercise in Song every day during advent. Sing them to your co-workers. Sing them to your children. Sing them in the bath. Just sing them. \n  ","href":"news/qll-announces-exercises-song.html"},{"title":"QlL blog","body":"\n    18 Nov 2008\n    QlL has finally crawled into the twenty-first century with its own blog.

While predominantly consisting of short stories, QlL also includes experimental story cycles, poetry, pastiche, satire and  \"lightning\" short-shorts. Like all experimental disciplines, QlL consists of both entertaining successes and informative failures: we do not pre-empt your decision on which work is which. \nSince late 2006, QlL has also been home to the Pocketfuls of Lies.

We decided to overhaul the site, and also put into print some of the best—or at any rate most representative—articles up to that point. The booklet that resulted from this was called A Pocketful of Lies.\nThis was given away for free to friends and readers at Christmas time, and we were surprised at how popular it became: the print run had to be extended and there were orders from around the world! Once the printed versions were released into the wild, the master PDF was uploaded to the Quiet little Lies site for people to download for free.\nA year later, towards the end of 2007, we had a number of stories lying in wait for what would become a second Pocketful of Lies. A gradual theme, or a set of underlying themes, took shape in the work as a whole, and it was eventually released as Stones and Bones. This was once again available both as a print version and, ultimately, a free download.\nThis year, we're producing another Pocketful of Lies, with a much stronger online element. We introduce Exercises in Song 2008, a combination of English folk songs and Oulipian experimentation.

Intuition calcifies, sinks and becomes dense rock, warmed by the sun or the blood. Stones and bones are the truth, wrapped in well-meaning, stupid nature that misinterprets and over- or understates.\nThey are primal urges, and they are the primal thwarting of urges. Where two desires clash and one nullifies the other, one is the urge and the other the thwart; one is from the bones through the heart, the other is from the stones through the head. Or both are bony, bent out of shape by the hidden, tripped-over stone.\nThe urge and the thwart can align themselves, which is living according to nature. Which is neither good nor evil; which is neither right nor wrong. Which is powerful, and dangerous.\nThe stone is money, the bone is sex. The stone is house; the bone is home. The stone is death; the bone is also death.\nWhat stories will be in Stones and Bones?\nStones and Bones consists of predominantly new material.

It starts as an itchy twitch in the tummy, then a desire to squirm in one's seat. The mouth either gets pulled back towards the ears or into a moue of distaste. Buttocks clench and this passes down to the legs which fidget in all directions, as the eyes are drawn inexorably to the next paragraph on. Being grossed out, bodily: from head to dirty-feeling toes.\nIn this combination of two novellas, Self expands on the idea of  gradual or sudden genital acquisition. Cock concerns itself  with a woman who slowly grows a penis; a vagina behind a man's knee  is the subject of Bull. The stories are visceral and ugly,  often portraying their cast at their most insensitive or sinister.  Their humour is bleak and barbed, and to feel that Self might not commit  to some overarching theme is to miss the fact that he is applying his  energies elsewhere.\nThe stories resist easy Freudian analysis, or overapplication of gender mooing---courageously, considering their subject matter---although everything succumbs to a hammer if you hit it hard enough, of course.   Carol's personality changes are as much a movement into the personality space her husband vacates, as a response to her new organs; John's feminization consists of blind, utilitarian actions, not castration fears.   But the strength of these stories is in their portrayal of typical people (if generally more neurotic than most) handling situations ineptly and messily. The hapless victim of \"John Bull\" is named so as to universalize his situation. Weakly Kafkaesque in their attempt to accumulate humour---and the casting of Bull as a farce confirms this---they fare much better when not compared to any of Self's heroes.\nAll this, as usual, takes place entirely in spite of Self's grandiloquence and tangled verbiage. These stories succeed on their own merits, as if they had been written by someone else and poorly related by a copywriter who has never seen a sentence to know how they actually work;   or, worse, never seen a bad sentence to know how they don't. The thickets and thorns he dumps around these two tales only do harm, especially the pointless narrator's scenes in Cock added apparently only for a bit of obvious symbolism, and to be able to end the story neatly. You often wonder whether Self had a reason for writing in this forced, pretentious way; or whether, ironically, he stumbled from one word to the next, with no more plan than his protagonists.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Cock and Bull        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Will Self        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/all-cock-and-browned.html"},{"title":"All his volcanoes flaming","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Klingsor's Last Summer        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Hermann Hesse        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1973)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nA young boy trespasses in his father's study, and the consequences of a childish act bear him painfully and fearfully into a kind of emotional adolescence. A tormented soul, having killed his wife and child, escapes to a Mediterranean town. Through a brief relationship with a dancer he achieves a kind of relief from his torture. Finally, the eponymous Klingsor paints, drinks, declaims and debauches his way through the world, like a shooting star blazing across the sky, to a conclusion that only realises itself through his work and his loves.\nAt first glance this triptych seems to have been assembled as an afterthought, as a compilation rather than a coherent work. But the three stories share deep thematic resemblances, not easily uncovered, rather than any inheritance of characters or plot or surface ideas. All deal with painful transitions and an inner life examined in the same way as one scrapes paint off wooden furniture to see how the items might look without the veneers of civilization. In each, conventional morality comes up against a queer but powerful mixture, primal and implacable, an ideal morality of the soul arising from a mixture of fay ce que voudras and the unsullied aesthetics that a perfect artist might be able to express.\nIf society as a whole were to adopt this rather Nietzschean paradigm of ethics then anarchy, or at any rate a sort of meritocratic feudalism, might result. But Hesse never suggests that mankind as a whole ought to make such an ethical switch. Instead, this is the unique morality---a spirituality of unique codes---that each of the characters must follow on his own to achieve redemption.  The boy eschews good and evil as incomprehensible, but perceives a deeper morality through fear of the chaos that he can instinctively see around the truly moral path; the man rejects his animalistic impulses to hurt and achieve advantage in favour of a dissolution of his own ego; the burnt-out artist surrenders himself to Bacchanalian impulses and the true expression of his soul in his art.\nHesse is invariably heavy-going, with melodramatic dialogue and concentration on the internal experiences of his characters. In fact, the density of his prose seems the greatest in the first story, that of the child: as this is arguably the most autobiographical of the three, that might shed light on its precise delineation of the narrator's young self. But the effect of the stories is cumulative, amassing a richness of sense and feeling as the book proceeds.Were he not to make allusions and some direct references to Wagner himself then Hesse's work would probably attract comparisons anyway. Here, lying hidden and quiescent, is a powerful furnace of a work, a crucible, to dip one's self into and emerge changed by its alchemy.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Klingsor's Last Summer        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Hermann Hesse        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1973)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/all-his-volcanoes-flaming.html"},{"title":"And then you fry","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Beach        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alex Garland        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThere is no such place as off the beaten track. On a fruitless search for the virgin island, Richard has come to this conclusion.  But in a chance meeting the soon-to-be suicide \"Daffy\" Duck hints at the perennial rumour of the unspoilt, idyllic paradise. Unlike most hapless backpackers Duck leaves Richard a map. A bond is forged between Richard and two French companions, who all sneak away to the government-protected island and The Beach, but not before Richard passes the map  onto two American tourists, Zeph and Sammy, smarter than they look.\nOur three heroes are accepted by The Beach's community, and find themselves in a resort ringed by sharks and drug dealers: apparently safe in their eden, but with flaming swords turning every which way at the borders. But division and danger inevitably seep in, precipitated by the disastrous attempts of Zeph and Sammy to infiltrate this paradise.  \nGarland plays games with lost innocence that make the scandal surrounding the film ironic and fitting: DiCaprio is implicit in the very despoiling that his alter ego has been trying to escape, and ultimately is taken over by and becomes accomplice to. At the same time unattainables and unspeakables hover in the air like demons on the shoulders of the wannabe prelapsarians, and the climax of the novel is Conradian: dark and inescapable, pleasurable tourism with its back turned.\nThe novel has its faults, not least the author's love of short chapters. Each has its own narrative arc, collapsing the book into a collection of short stories, hung off the same thread. The climax is not felt until the last few pages, therefore, and nor do Richard's gaming and war-film obsessions really manifest themselves except as plot devices that put a twist to the rest of the book each time they appear. In addition the bending of Richard's character is never dealt with convincingly---the last great leap he makes into \"Vietnam\" is confusing and inexplicably inexplicable.\nNonetheless the book is a chilling account of the quest to regain innocence, and the unstoppability of the outside world's influx: poisoning, destroying, but ultimately humanizing with a euthanasia that frees the inhabitants of The Beach.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Beach        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alex Garland        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/and-then-you-fry.html"},{"title":"Better safe than sullied","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Safety Net        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Heinrich Böll        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1981)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nSociety crumbles. Our industrial masters live cloistered, surrounded by security men and measures. Culture desecrates itself, destroying what it once cherished. sexual tolerance leads to sexual permissivity leads to sexual perversion, as a wave of pornographic media and attitudes swamps the world around Fritz Tolm, newspaper owner and president of the shadowy Association. We consume our dead and our children; the Church is corrupt; the State is authoritarian and hated. And on top of all this, not only does someone want to kill Tolm, but the hand that deals the blow might even be that of Veronica, his daughter-in-law and father of his grandson Holger.\nThe actions of the Tolm family in this book, which make up what is essentially a romantic melodrama, are all set against the safety net of security, which threatens to stifle every act they perform. Their lives are founded on, structured around, and shackled by the measures designed to make them safe. But in the glare of publicity at his new appointment as Association president Tolm finds a core of resolution in his family, which is tried and tested by the events of the rest of the novel---Sabine's infidelity, Rolf's intransigence, and young Holger's sudden reappearance (a harbinger of his mother's impending violent action)---but emerges strong and joyful. This resolution carries him through all the technicalities and intricacies of the measures intended for his safety to the books complex, multiply-bluffed climax.\nBöll's very prose is made from the vacillations and confusions within the minds of his cast. In addition, the book assumes (generally laudably) that aspects of this dystopia can be hinted at rather than laboured. These two tendencies do combine to make the reading experience a complicated one, yet it's a joy to watch each paragraph take one expertly choreographed, twisted dance-step further towards sympathy with these trapped people. The snares seem so convincing when encountered singly, until one looks back at where the individual has come from and is shocked. He writes lyrically, liltingly, reflexively and poetically, producing something from the same stable as Heller's obsessive Something Happened, but somehow less dense: Böll can both satirize the 1970s with this timeless tale and at the same time tell a beautiful, human story.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Safety Net        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Heinrich Böll        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1981)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/better-safe-sullied.html"},{"title":"Bleeding-hearts liberal","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Arthur Japin        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2001)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nRace is a tricky subject to discuss. As Berkeley Breathed, cartoonist  behind Bloom County, discussed in an interview with the Onion AV Club:\n Don't touch it. Run. Hide. Smile and say you love everybody equally, and  don't make any jokes as you back out of the room [...]. There isn't  a shade of a chance for anything resembling a real discussion about race  occurring publicly in this country for another... well, ever. Tirades,  yes. Conversations that don't become tirades after the first sentence  spoken? No.\nIn European culture we have a much weaker \"race issue\" than exists in the States, arising from a feeling of self-righteousness over the fact that, if we didn't actually jettison slavery before the US, then at least we were nicer about it The primary effect, and probably function, of Japin's The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi is to explode both this myth and the idea that the noble savage can be somehow tamed and Europeanized like Kafka's Affe.\nWriting about racism---as with sexism, ageism, or any kind of discrimination against a persecuted minority that perceives itself as such---is generally best carried out by the disinterested. However, early European racism is clearly Japin's bête noire (as it were) and The Two Hearts... suffers because of it. The arc of the book is strong, and individual scenes harden on reading into tough kernels of authorial intent thanks to their simplicity and directness.   Mesoscopically, however, the narrative is unevenly paced and cluttered with explications of Dutch crypto-slavery in the 19th Century. The irony present in the scene-setting at the beginning, when the two princes Kwasi and Kwame are taken from their African homeland to be educated in Holland in return for \"slave\" trading, is confusingly and lengthily expounded; the corresponding revelations at the end of the book, where Kwasi finally uncovers the extent of bureaucratic embodiment of the \"noblesse de peau\" that has dogged him throughout his attempts at a civil service career, are clumsily handled, and lead to less of a reconciliation of complex and conflicting threads of his life than the extended, half-chapter shrug of an old man in his dotage.\nIt doesn't help that this period of Dutch history is so obscure, and the book suffers further harm at the hands of the confusing cast of characters in the higher echelons of Dutch society. Three or four Willems (it isn't clear) and at least two Sophies make descriptions of life at court obscure, and often the resultant confusion overlaps what would otherwise be a powerful scene.\nBut perhaps we shouldn't blame Japin for the difficulties that his historical premise have unavoidably placed in his path, and be grateful that he hasn't forced the reader to wade through appendices and family trees. A flawed book, then: but one that shares many of its flaws with any account of a previously neglected period of history;  unlike its drier cousins, The Two Hearts... has a worthiness that manages to penetrate the necessary tangle of humdrum, unavoidable fact.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Arthur Japin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2001)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/bleeding-hearts-liberal.html"},{"title":"The blind receive their sight; the lame walk","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    I, Claudius        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Robert Graves        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £12.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe archetypal fool could, were he morally capable of it, get away with murder. Nobody would suspect the court jester. Yet his morals are often more finely tuned---if more flexible in his personal behaviour---than those of the murderers that surround him. So it is with Claudius, the lame, stammering child of the Julio-Claudian family, derided throughout his youth but destined to be emperor. A fictional autobiography has the potential to be a playground for its authors wildest flights of fancy. Who knows what the narrator really thought, or really did outside of what historical accounts are availble?  It's all too easy to spin the most fantastic tale that history will allow (typically detecting the events of homicide(s)), such as Ackroyd did with Hawksmoor and Tully with The Crimes of Charlotte Brontë. Graves, on the  other hand, accomplishes the far more difficult task of presenting the  story with its boring warts and all: of making the dull grind almost as  exciting as the juicy exploits of the Roman royal family.\nThat Graves often disagrees with the opinions of his sources is a  tremendous asset to the novel. Historically he relies heavily (as does the rest of the world) on Suetonius, Tacitus and Cassius Dio.  These, the only histories extant, are in no way contemporaneous with the  events but rather toe the Flavian line with carefully crafted rhetoric. The quandary of the Flavians was to deify Augustus---and hence  establish the source of imperial power---while claiming that with each  successive generation his progeny had become more decadent and corrupt;  compared, at any rate, to the Flavians.\nOnly when Graves escapes this clearly biased narrative does the story deepen, thicken, flower: pick your metaphor, but Graves' independence of thought is what makes I, Claudius so enjoyable. Livia's evil  is sheer joy for the reader, and the complex character of  Tiberius---presented simultaneously as pedestrian leader, Livia's moll,  bad-tempered penny-pincher and generally well-meaning buffoon, the ill  effects of whose reign did not stretch beyond the few hundred senators  into the general populace like his beneficience did---is constructed with  such clarity and easy resolution of its internal paradoxes. Even Caligula,  pace Lives of the Cæsars starts promisingly, and his  degeneration is as believable as it is spectacular.\nAs asides, it's interesting to consider the moral agency of the main players, and the rle and responsibilities of the historian in the light of I, Claudius.  The former is evident in the suspiciously repeated pattern of the female characters in the novel---Livia, Urgulanilla, Julia, Agrippina---carrying out a long-running Manichean battle, their weapons and shields consisting of the males, who mete out punishments and provide alibis: even the emperors. The latter seems to mirror an internal wrangle of Graves', revealed both in Claudius' opinions of Livy and Pollio, and in Claudius' own desire to be like the less journalistic Pollio: a careful recorder of the facts. It reveals much, about Graves' opinions of Livy and his followers, and perhaps even about his own doubts over the dramatisation he has attempted in this novel.\nBut he needn't worry: the revelation of Claudius' inner self is the book's coup de théatre and a service to history, history as a desire to construct a meaningful narrative and understand that narrative. Perhaps it's overly complimentary, but scarcely so for an autobiography. More importantly this book reaches beyond the typical explanation for Claudius' fate and its circumstantial simplicity.   It reveals to us the hidden seed of Claudius' suitability as an emperor. For 1900 years everyone saw him as being in the right place at the right time. Graves suggests to us that he might also have been the right man for the job.\n  \n    \n            \n                    I, Claudius        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Robert Graves        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £12.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/blind-receive-their-sight-lame-walk.html"},{"title":"Body as text","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Simmons Papers        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Philipp Blom        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Faber and Faber        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1995)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nPurely for interest's sake, I found myself reading papers purportedly from the estate of one Paul Simmons, Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy. These publicize Simmons' time working on a great project, language's perpetual perfecting by a secret international network of intellectuals-as-encyclopaedists. Or do they? It is never clear whether Simmons is actually writing about himself, or himself writing fictional prose. This doubly literary persona, known only by the initial letter 'P' on which he works, archiving and detailing word meanings and etymologies, finds himself suffering from psychiatric problems, the pursuit of words perverting the old gentleman's personality.\nPre-empting the reader's own powers, Blom has provided footnotes and cross-commentary from imaginary critics who parrot received wisdom in their fields on the nature and intent of Simmons' legacy. Complete with a pseudobiographical preface, The Simmons Papers' pose as a palimpsest is clear. Blom is playing tricks, which occasionally fall flat: knowing and arch, sesquipedalian and sixth-form. When Professor Trefusis from a certain polytechnic pokes out of the pages early on, the posture has clearly already been assumed: Blom wants us to know that he considers us wise indeed, but no more wise than he. So we put up with a protectorate of in-case-you-missed-its and  this-is-the-clever-bits. Providence smiles upon us!\nPlainly Simmons, or 'P', is shown as pitiful and pernickety in this occasionally sympathetic portrayal. His plaintive passions towards the pretty woman in 'M' plunge us into the depths of his soul, and his prolonged longings for her stand starkly against his bookish bumblings among biblical bromides and the Shakespearean shibboleths that his work warrants yet which he can scarcely stomach. Yet it is all contrivance and claustrophobia: the intellectual powerhouse is clearly a poor man's Bodleian Library, Simmons a potluck of whoever Blom bumped into in Oxford, and the project a poorly defined pastiche of academic endeavour.\nProbably Blom would find in Simmons a moderate fan. His protagonist would pore over this book permeated with plays on words and postmodern flourishes. But Simmons' interest would be clinical and cold: the linguistic games would provide him with hours of particularizing, but in passing he might well admit that the a better editor would have produced a better book.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Simmons Papers        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Philipp Blom        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Faber and Faber        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1995)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/body-text.html"},{"title":"On the case and on the job","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Gun Seller        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Hugh Laurie        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Mandarin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2000)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nHugh Laurie's only foray into prose, if you don't count narrating Great Expectations, is a luridly-jacketed novel that looks like it's by Irvine Welsh or Michael Ridpath or some other triumph of packaging. In truth it's a sprawling spy novel whose comedy would, in the hands of anyone else, turn ironic and varnished. Laurie manages to keep up the self-effacing shtick throughout, however, and as with many debuts this book's narrator has more than a sliver of the author running through him.\nThe retired Captain Thomas Lang is propositioned by a stranger in an Amsterdam bar to assassinate an American millionaire. Declining the  offer---while holding the stranger's most intimates in a vice-like grip---he  races to warn the millionaire of the contract out on his life. Time and  time again he makes the wrong deduction, leading him further into the  twists of an international conspiracy to organize a terrorist attack and  boost the sales of the new helicopter that will be on hand to neutralize  the terrorists. This apparently ludicrous plot is made easy to swallow by  the method of drip-feeding inconsequentials early on, more in the manner  of Agatha Christie than Jack Higgins.\nThe story is told in a relaxed, somewhat bemused style, lapsing into  the self-assurance of the trained unarmed combatant only when really  valid: Thomas Lang is no detective, and no plot devices are needed to  transform him into one. The strength of this book lies in its  warts-and-all presentation of the central character: like James Bond  taking a break from bashing the Blofeld because he really needs a wee, or  a cup of tea. Such humanity is refreshing.\nOccasionally Laurie's relaxed style becomes practically horizontal. He makes slips of style and falls back on standard Fry-and-Laurie-isms, including the over-quoted \"x, if you will, y.\" In this he's as guilty as his erstwhile partner, who often coasts through sections of his books (much of The Star's Tennis Balls being a case in point) on the strength of his character. Both authors often give the impression of presenting you with a rambling story told unedited to the reader, by the author, at a party or down the phone. But whereas Stephen Fry's slips come across as pompous, Hugh Laurie is relentlessly apologetic. Whichever the reader can stomach most is a matter of taste, but it seems a shame that, when unguarded, both of them are so very true to type.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Gun Seller        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Hugh Laurie        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Mandarin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2000)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/case-and-job.html"},{"title":"Chang'd in outward lustre","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Rebel Angels        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Robertson Davies        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP), Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1989)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nA monk, a priest and a respected academic go in search of an unpublished manuscript by Rabelais, stolen from a billionaire art dealer (now deceased). The manuscript is the key to the future life of Maria Magdalena Theotoky, bringer of God to the world, and the three heroes are all Rebel Angels, bringing fire to the woman. Paracelsus makes occasional appearances, along with the magical healing powers of excrement and a gypsy sorceress who cures priceless violins with horse dung.\nFantasy? No. Robertson Davies has, by layering meaning and symbols on top of the otherwise mundane and self-absorbed world of Toronto academia, brought forth a violin from the dirt. Where fantasy imagines the perfect violin and falls short, Davies takes this smashing little instrument and makes it sing. He's not exactly in the league of Stradivari (for the duration of this novel at least), but still nonetheless a capable virtuoso, a Guarnieri: fine workmanship and enjoyable, intricate sounds lend a richness to a novel where very little happens and so much is reported.\nThe ineffectuality of the lead characters is striking: Maria and her two main Rebel Angels talk the talk, and make as if to push and act and do, but it is down to the mouthy, overliterate Parlabane to move the story to its crisis, and his decisions are themselves communicated by him to the rest of the world through a flurry of self-conflicting correspondence. These people's lives are still self- and book-absorbed; while the glittering world spins around them they sit poised at the centre of the dance. Through this conceit he builds up a more complex acadème than the usual stereotype of the ivory tower, before running it through with harsh realities that cure as much as kill.\nDavies weaves an intellectual yarn: deep, but narrowed in vision to the confines of the university; convoluted, but ending up not far from its starting point; clever, but clever-clever. With all the action occurring off the pages, including the prologue that precipitates Maria's love for Hollier, what is left is nonetheless more exercise for the brain than you'd expect from something so rambly. But without some sort of bite it reads like a thriller without death, a love story without passion, or heaven without its angels.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Rebel Angels        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Robertson Davies        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP), Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1989)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/changd-outward-lustre.html"},{"title":"Claudius the man","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Claudius the God        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Robert Graves        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £12.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nHaving rescued Claudius' character so wholeheartedly in the prequel I, Claudius, Robert Graves continues to fabricate the autobiography of his unlikely protagonist. Claudius is a sort of off-white sheep of the otherwise black-as-night Julio-Claudians, afflicted with plenty of unfortunate hereditary problems but free (more or less) of the psychotic nature that blossomed into flowers of mistrust, paranoia and megalomania among his relatives. But why should Graves pursue Claudius' character any further? In doing so, after all, he's created a chronologically lopsided diptych, as this volume spans around a quarter of the time covered by the first. It all looks a bit like overreaching. Is  there any need?\nWell, whereas the first book redefines Claudius as a quiet savant worthy of his scheming genes---less the fool, more playing the fool---the sequel goes some way to rescuing him as a human being. The test of all his kinsmen's characters was, ultimately, how each fared as emperor; so Claudius must also undergo this baptism of fire. History demands it, and Graves tells it. And he pulls off the trick of making the sequel, however weaker in synopsis, largely as enjoyable, as layered and as strong as I, Claudius.\nIn his lengthier battle descriptions the tone of Graves' primary sources does sometimes sneak in, an ethos of actually caring whether or not the elephants were on this hill rather than that one, or the chariots were going down the left or right flank. But it's all told through Claudius' rich, sympathetic, occasionally cantankerous narration and this helps paper over any minor cracks. He even handles Claudius' sudden change of leadership, after betrayal by Messalina comes to light, exceptionally well given its historical incomprehensibility. That, like every other known fact about the man, is enlarged and enriched by this insightful, startling uprooting of dry history in order to replant in the fertile, inner soil of the individual life.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Claudius the God        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Robert Graves        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £12.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/claudius-man.html"},{"title":"Comynycacyon betwyxt Burgess, and our sauyour Jhesu","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Little Wilson and Big God        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe autobiography of someone so prolific and polymathic as Burgess inevitably carries with it heavy baggage, a retinue of expectations and assumptions and questions that must be answered. From his very first disclaimer, though, Burgess both shifts the ground away from his ego and towards his experiences and history, and at the same time assures us that this will be no whitewash. If this is to be a redrafting at the hands of Memory---inevitable, and announced as such, following the destruction of most of his papers at the hands of Malaysian termites---then there will be no clear intent to sanctify the author.\nEvery wart on Anthony Burgess' head has been counted. Most of them by the man himself, and some fifty percent of those in the first half of his autobiography, Little Wilson and Big God. Generous with the reader and cynical of his own literati excesses, Burgess is loveable from the first flash of his wicked humour. He's a self-acknowledged fudger, if not exactly an outright fraud, but he can both acknowledge it and get over his Catholic guilt at the fact. The master skimmer, faker in part,  wins in the end because of the knowledge, wit and research---let's refrain from using the word \"genius\"---that he needn't fake: his intellectual laziness and intellectual robustness together making him so exciting and infuriating.\nWe follow Burgess through his troubled paternal relationship, terminated in his childhood, and his experiences at the hands of his step-family. He makes it to university, but is hardly the model pupil. Arguably his extracurricular interests save him as a human being and, spurred on by the alternatives---a teacher in the army and at a school, and various jobs in the colonies---and the sudden appearance of serious illness, his hubris, life history and willingness to just sit and write set him on the career path we now know him to have chosen.\nAll the time we are conscious of Burgess analysing himself, prising open old wounds for us to see, ashamed but not faltering in the task of the biographer who, even if the subject is himself, and for all his desire to paint for posterity, respects the audience he expects for his book just enough to be honest. Even if you allow for the shameless polyamory of his marital life (on both sides), he treated his wife shabbily, neglect which he clearly believed led to her eventual descent into alcoholism and death from a liver complaint. Here is no saint, no god, no perfect writing machine.\nYou can argue, as Roger Lewis does in his recent biography of Burgess, that such disingenuousness is bluff and counterbluff ad nauseam. That is not the point. Nor is it the point that Lewis' work is mean-spirited, poorly researched or simply untrue, although it is. The plain fact is that Burgess writes well: he engages, he mocks, his turns of phrase are not so elegant as to be stylized, nor so clumsy as to be gauche. Such writing sits on solid foundations of artistry, skill, knowledge and learning. Lewis might want to stop crying naked! at the knowingly unclothed emperor and learn a thing or---maybe, just maybe, if he concentrates very hard---even two.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Little Wilson and Big God        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/comynycacyon-betwyxt-burgess-and-our-sauyour-jhesu.html"},{"title":"Earthy prowess","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Earthly Powers        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe Toomey family and its spouses span the two worlds of secular and spiritual entertainment: the former popular, and the latter trying to be more so under the auspices of the new pope and brother-in-law to narrator Kenneth Toomey. Over eighty years Ken tries to hold the family together, popularize highbrow writing (or more often vice versa) and hide his homosexuality from the disapproving authorities and his more disapproving relatives. Meanwhile Don Carlo barges his way through the echelons of the Roman Catholic Church. The one, blighted along many of with his comrades-in-art by what he considers to be original sin; the other, comprehending the sinner, but unwilling to denounce that doctrine which draws most criticism to him and his allies.\nCaptured by the novel at the end of his life, the narrator and confirmed atheist must reconcile his own beliefs with undeniable miracles performed by Carlo, whom the Roman Catholic Church would see beatified if only the testimony of a confirmed non-believer could strengthen their cause. We find Burgess in these semi-autobiographical waters, sometimes treading, sometimes swimming powerfully (against currents to which lesser writers might yield), and sometimes splashing around in a fug, making you wonder why he doesn't towel himself off and go and do something else.\nOminously, the book starts slowly and painfully. These birth pangs lower Toomey/Burgess' prose to the level of the amateur writer: awkward phrasing, overintellectual posturing and excessive descriptions imply a difficult time ahead. But the rambling tale quickly warms up, and after a few chapters is striding through history, directing its players like chess pieces, making inscrutable moves that plan in irony for a plot (historical or often pseudo-historical) twist some ten years distant.\nThe appearance of several members of the entre deux guerres literati will yield either wicked grins or pained cringes, according to taste: although most will baulk at the forced (and forcedly ironic) chumminess in calling the century's most astonishing writer \"Jim Joyce\", the dirty truth about what George Russell was really doing on Bloomsday more than compensates for such aesthetic agonies. Certainly this novel weaves a dazzling history out of disparate and unlikely materials, although one must then contend with the entanglement of fictional and apocryphal threads in the weft.\nUltimately the story suffers from its length (a thick wodge reminiscent of doorstop thrillers), becoming meandering and losing its climax in a huddle of successive denouements. This doesn't harm the pull of its yarn, but the ante has been raised and we expect more from Burgess of all people. Still, there are treasures to be unearthed here, rich parodies and pastiches of the literary and the decidedly unliterary---the lyrics to the musical rendition of Ulysses being a case in point---and multilingual jokes that work even for the monoglot.\nHere is a story, then, that can be enjoyed on a casual reading, and has much for the more circumspect; but the murky, peaty depths stop too soon, too abruptly. In a book about a writer, written by the writer's writer, this is as disconcerting as a swimming pool four foot shallower than advertised. But if not having the heart to compose a great, \"high-art\" acrostic---as the protagonist could not bring himself to do either---is a sin that only our mate Jim was ever able to resist, and then only one and a half times, then it can hardly be considered an original one.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Earthly Powers        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/earthy-prowess.html"},{"title":"Every doyen tells a story","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    English Short Stories (1900 to the present)        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Giles Gordon        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Everyman        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWhile the established media seem to vaguely, erratically support what they consider to be a renaissance in the short story, as a mode of expression it lumbers heedlessly on, giving a passing nod but no more to the bright young things that grace publications largely unsuitable to its format: by which I mean the Guardian magazine rather than Take a Break. But what of its history? Where has it been, this queer, marginal way of writing, alternately considered either the last resort of those who love novels, but couldn't write a whole one, or the apotheosis of minimalism, pared down, honed and sharpened to a deadly point?\nThis collection might go some way to answering that. Some two dozen authors, from Conrad and Kipling through to Ballard and McEwan, are each represented by a story each of variable length and, surprisingly, quality. Saki's chilling Sredni Vashtar takes some beating, although Ballard's The Intensive Care Unit comes close, with its icy conviction and utter believability. Kipling's Dayspring Mishandled, McEwan's Solid Geometry and Wells' The Truth About Pyecraft are all solid, enjoyable yarns. Conrad, on the other hand, provides dramatic tension that goes nowhere and just tangles itself up in knots; Woolf's Lappin and Lapinova is trite, doubly-embedded faux-naivety that pales in comparison with the strongest work on display here.\nIf there's any trend to be gleaned from these stories, it's an obscure one. Certainly the best writers don't always write the best short stories. One might go further and say that the most dramatic writers, those with either the greatest clarity or whose words have the tightest turning circle, produce shorts which mature the seemliest; but this scarcely begins to do justice to either Kipling or Wodehouse's styles. If nothing else, the collection shows that it's simply not enough to assemble what philistines would sneer at as a list of established \"classics\" and hope they will carry the day: such reading lists would eventually make philistines of us all.\n  \n    \n            \n                    English Short Stories (1900 to the present)        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Giles Gordon        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Everyman        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/every-doyen-tells-story.html"},{"title":"Extraordinarily normal","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    House Mother Normal        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    B.

Hugh Carmody loves Millicent Threepwood. Ronald Fish thinks Sue Brown loves Hugh Carmody, but Percy Pilbeam is the real threat. Lord Galahad Threepwood is writing his memoirs, the mere prospect of which sends Lady Constance into spasms. Speaking of spasms, if Baxter doesn't return to the position of personal secretary at Blandings Hall, which Carmody has filled since the unfortunate flowerpot incident, her ladyship will have one, or at any rate wish one upon Emsworth, lord of the hall. But Baxter is too busy stealing that manuscript, while Carmody steals his lordship's prize pig; or did Sir Gregory steal the animal, to distract from Pilbeam, under his employ, finding those damn memoirs that he too wants destroyed? Well, over all this nonsense presides the woolgathering Lord Emsworth; or at least he would, if Lady Constance didn't try to do it for him. Besides, everyone knows Beach the butler is really in charge. But now, suddenly, he's hiding the pig and saving the manuscript and matchmaking the couple and fixing the drinks: something has to give.\nBeing spontaneously farcical is easy, as almost every character in Summer Lighting proves to him or herself sooner or later. Composing and executing the perfect farce as a writer, however, takes skill, effort and an innate recognition of the perfect balance of all your characters' desires and detractions against each other. The result of Wodehouse's hard work whizzes round at breakneck pace like a crazed fairground ride, out of control and with the glorious, whirring machinery just visible as it pirouettes its way down the hillside into the lake. The stored energy is released in a rush, and what could have been a foolish throwaway holiday read is both that and a complicated, enjoyable firework display.\nThe novel is eventually, easily, discarded. Of course: that's the point. But the short stories accompanying the novel, bound together in an out-of-print Heron edition, are a little too easily forgotten. The series, based around Lord Emsworth and his wayward son Freddie, disappoints. Each one's brevity reduces the possibility of complexity and energy that makes Wodehouse worth reading. You don't see the three chapters of winding up and clicking pieces in place; then any unwinding happens all too quickly and the pace is all wrong. Still, Wodehouse's writing still bangs a gong for a genre often condemned for its shallowness and silliness. Or was that Beach, calling us in for another course?\n  \n    \n            \n                    Blandings Castle        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    P. G.

A middle-aged couple's life is turned upside town, as their London flat is turned inside-out, swept clean by burglars and bringing on a seizure in the husband. A teacher's father begins the long, quiet process of dying in his sleep while his family, and the ties within it, whirl and stretch and start to snap around him.\nEach story in this anthology acts like a window into other people's lives, and revel in the loose ends and commonplace, irksome complexities from which all of our own stories suffer. Each has also been fêted by the press, and rightly so: Bennett shows us what it's like not just to be human, but to be other humans, to feel the itch of that person scratching over there and not just to perceive that they have an itch. And each story has its own individual arc and tempo: now pulling you along, now stopping to show you a detail, now involving you in the convolutions and complications.\nBennett sometimes dwells on details a little too much; a little gauchely, as the voices of the characters whose lives he is narrating suddenly leak out, and take over the telling from the otherwise disinterested voice of the author. But, as with his Talking Heads, such clumsiness could be just as studied as unintentional, and lends an endearing, conversational tone to what might otherwise be an unbelievable collision of circumstances. Ultimately every single word is engaged in the act of apologising for, indeed defending, people who any other writer might give up as inexcusable and indefensible; only the artist's own giving-up, Bennett implies, has itself no defence.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Three Stories        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alan Bennett        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Profile        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/father-stroke-and-holy-mess.html"},{"title":"First impressions last","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Too Loud a Solitude        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Bohumil Hrabal        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nImagine you're employed to pulp works of fiction and literature, compressing them to heavy paper bundles for recycling. For reasons never fully explained you must destroy copy after copy of Kants, Gauguins, Lao-Tzes, Rimbauds. But you start to take books home. You fill shelf after shelf. You construct works of art based on juxtapositions of knowledge only you'll ever see, or paintings placed on the outside of bundles for everyone in the city to see as they're transported away. But how do you survive thirty-five years of this creative destruction? How do you live with yourself?\nThis beautiful, word-soaked novella from Bohumil Hrabal attempts to answer that question by giving Haňt'a, the self-educated narrator, leave to speak. It sets the beauty of art, and the art inherent in a job beautifully done, against the everyday dirt and grime of slaughterhouse meat-wrappers and mouldy, mice-ridden sacks of once-paper. Rich and condensed, it's more reminiscent of a warming, spicy single malt, drunk alone and pensively, than a sustaining meal or a night out with the author as a drinking companion.\nToo Loud a Solitude demonstrates a clarity of thought and expression reminiscent of the best of Milan Kundera. It shows eloquently how the inner life survives and continues to express itself in spite of the police-state actions that seem, dimly, to be directing the pulping and transportation of art: Haňt'a is read a poem at knifepoint by a frustrated artist; a singer threatens the inhabitants of a bar so that he might perform, briefly, and then run. But Haňt'a himself is the true revelation, a quiet, unassuming, boozy man whose soul harbours the entirety of Western literature, an appreciation of life in all its forms, and the sorrow of lost love and unexpressed emotion, bottled up, condensed, potent like a toxin.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Too Loud a Solitude        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Bohumil Hrabal        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/first-impressions-last.html"},{"title":"Girl, uninterpreted","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Morvern Callar        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alan Warner        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, Feb 17, 2006, and on the ReadReverb website)\nIf you arrived home to find your boyfriend had slashed his own throat, shortly after chopping his own hand off with a machete, what would you do? Probably, not the same as Morvern Callar does. She switches on her walkman, steps over him (avoiding the blood) and carries on as if nothing has happened: tidying the body when it becomes necessary, keeping her shift at the local supermarket, and going out drinking with her best friend Lanna.  Only later does she discover that, along with a suicide note and all his money, her boyfriend has left her a book, waiting on the computer's hard drive to be published. There's even the beginnings of a publishing contract. All she has to do is print it out, maybe changing the name on it first.... Oh, and there's the matter of the body as well, of course.\nIn a dialect-heavy style popularized by Irvine Welsh and Alasdair Gray among others, Alan Warner lets Morvern drag us stumbling through the sleepy, characterful village where she grew up and lives; to Spain in search of music, a scene, that intangible togetherness of which ecstasy convinces; and to London, for the more down-to-earth motive of passing off her boyfriend's book as her own. Her uncomfortably close, semi-sexual relationship with Lanna waxes and wanes, strengthened by the prospect of a holiday, weakened by accusations of infidelity. Morvern, though, remains utterly impenetrable, like a puzzle with a piece missing. Indeed, explanatory chunks of this novel seem to be absent: perhaps Morvern, conjured beside Warner's writing desk, removed incriminating passages herself in a fit of mischief. It's a shame, because the remainder is enjoyably macabre and threatening in a Lynchian mode. But it's also infuriatingly aware of its own mysteriousness, and is equally Lynchian in that it reads like its plot arc was cut down in its prime.\nMorvern is in some ways a Holly Golightly for the 1990s, transplanting the brittleness of Capote's heroine into rave scenes, explicit sex and Club 18-30 holidays. But for Morvern there is no moment of true fragility that might hook the sympathies of the reader. When the emotional distance is reduced---during her biggest row with Lanna---the intellectual distance is in a way increased to compensate, as one has to rapidly reassess all her actions and reactions so far. At one point a Spanish hotel clerk lets slip that \"callar\" translates as \"to not speak\", and Warner is probably using him to lay his own cards on the table: Morvern's allure lies in the thoughts she leaves undeclared. But in such behaviour as hers there's a fine line between Callar and callous. Perhaps in those chapters and pages, that we can only guess at by their stark absence, we're actually told which one she really is.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Morvern Callar        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alan Warner        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/girl-uninterpreted.html"},{"title":"The gods are on the side of the stranger","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Aeneid        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Virgil        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1986)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe story of Aeneas' flight from Troy, and his eventual sowing of the seeds of the Roman empire: everyone knows it and nobody's read it all. Generations of grammar- and public-schoolboys have studied chunks of Virgil's epic at school, with varying amounts of context to aid digestion. While it's certainly beyond the scope of this review to discuss the Aeneid's place in the classical literary pantheon---who would dare, realistically?---it's nonetheless worth asking the separate questions: how has the Aeneid aged? is it worth reading, if not casually then at any rate on the sofa, train or beach? Hundreds of thousands of copies of this book, in various translations (here Jackson Knight's), inhabit the Classics shelves. Should some be rescued from the indignity of the pulping bin?\nThe answer is generally affirmative, with some reservations. The characterizations and relationships, with some histrionic exceptions, are warm, rich and complex. With a little background knowledge---for example that Virgil, like Shakespeare, wrote his work to placate to the hegemony of the time, each establishing an empire's semi-divine right to exist and indeed prosper---there is political and moral depth here that earns for the Aeneid the right to be considered a current classic as well as a literary milestone. The moral balance and interconnectedness, which we would now call karma, and the weird, Delphic fatalism that pervades Aeneas' quest to fulfil Jupiter's will, is intriguing and often wildly unpredictable in both cause and effect.\nMost of the battle scenes can be omitted, excepting most obviously the death of Camilla. But the most fascinating part of the book is Aeneas himself: his reactions during the sacking of Troy, and his legendary, doomed relationship with Dido. For a modern audience Aeneas is at his most intriguing, and frightening, during his moments of greatest piety and certainty in Jupiter's will. His eyes flash; his hair floats; he's a Byronesque hero and a flawed, eccentric human at the same time. Aeneas as a conduit of the power of the gods is chilling indeed. In its protagonist, if nowhere else, the Aeneid has undergone a miracle of aging, changing from mythical epic into character study, acquiring new flavours over time that Virgil possibly never intended. This epic shows that some old classics never die; they just follow their own, opaque destinies.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Aeneid        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Virgil        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1986)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/gods-are-side-stranger.html"},{"title":"Good luck, but no charm","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Dice Man        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Luke Rhinehart        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    HarperCollins        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nLuke Rhinehart is not content. His job as a psychiatrist is driving him crazy, at odds with his newly discovered Zen Buddhism. His marriage is a neurotic, classically 1970s mess, in which he uses tenets of his half-cocked religion to manoeuver his wife, passive-aggressively, into a state of dialectic impotence. He loves and yet does not love his children; he relates to the aspects of his patients he is most honour-bound to treat; and, like any privileged white middle-class male, he wants out of the terribly mundanity of his life. And so he discovers the die, and eventually dice, which at first inject a little playful randomness into his routine. But as the variety proves addictive Rhinehart finds himself using the dice to make more and more of his decisions, as he forces sex, violence and erratic eccentricities on others, and homelessness, poverty and loneliness on himself. As the dice become the pivot around which his entire life revolves, he meets an old patient, as borderline as himself, and has a sudden flash of inspiration: now he can share with the rest of the world the guiding principles of the Dice Man, one person at a time.\nIn Rhinehart the character, Rhinehart the author (George Cockcroft, pseudonymously) has written the most bizarre literary creation ever to exist outside Gallowglass or Tom Ripley. Rhinehart is meant to be simultaneously both the everyman and his own subversion, by starting off as a confused, directionless therapy-mensch and ultimately transforming himself into a destiny-filled, fate-directed übermensch, as the dice take hold of his life and strip him of the socio-cultural norms that have held him prisoner for so long. In reality, and partly in the language of his profession, Rhinehart is more akin to the casual neurotic who achieves transference from dull but safe (and creatively and morally fecund) society to arbitrary, irrelevant (and thus terrifyingly dangerous) amoral edicts. These then tear apart his sense of self and belonging, while bolstering his conviction that those very methods provide the quickest, wildest, most exciting route to enlightenment. Rhinehart is gathering speed on a downward slope towards his own oblivion, swaddled in the convictions that every step along it is a step towards salvation.\nWhat's most surprising about The Dice Man is the banality with which its violence, arrogance and sheer wilful stupidity are presented. Rape and murder are treated as interesting experiments that Rhinehart the narrator conducts, rather than real, repugnant actions with real, reprehensible consequences, that cause real physical and mental damage to others. He hates women, other people, the simple everyday, and basic human relationships; he cannot deal with responsibility or any kind of repetition. Seeing himself as an iconoclast, he's really an irritable, attention-deficient fool; seeing himself as some sort of model Zen pupil drifting on the ebb and flow of the world's tide, he's really an agent of profound and dangerous activity.\nUltimately, the Dice Man's greatest hubris is that he has attempted to disguise all these quite wilful, intentional acts as consequences of a random, almost godlike agency that exists outside himself. But even the most fervent horoscope-follower or rune-caster has more simple empathy than the narrator, whose basic, psychopathic inability to comprehend the notion of other people's existences leaves him free to follow whatever silly ideas can enter his head, however ultimately idiotic or empty. His childish attempts to wish away his own humanity shock in the same way as a child's crimes shock, and should be treated accordingly. Compared to the psychological investigations of Kundera or Cockcroft's fellow travellers Pirsig and Kesey, this is the giggling, random swearing of the primary school.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Dice Man        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Luke Rhinehart        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    HarperCollins        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/good-luck-no-charm.html"},{"title":"Hand in love","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Maurice        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    E.M.

The lead role is filled by a genial young man, vapid and self-serving, whose awakening homosexuality brings him into close, physical (but not overtly sexual)   contact with Clive, an acquaintance at university.\nIn a novel with so many parallels with Forster's own situation, analysis of the few differences are inevitable. Maurice is Forster's intellectual and physical opposite: slow-headed if not actually stupid; well-built and fully aware of the fact; a man of business, society and common-sense. The roller-coaster ride his emotions undertake build in him a moral sense, if not an intellectual one, and lead him from college through disgrace and enterprise into heartache and eventual---tentatively optimistic---true love. Clive, and later Clive's gamekeeper Alec, awaken self-knowledge in Maurice. If he cannot change, and cannot improve, then he can at least be true to his own self: a trite sentiment now, but a dangerous idea during Forster's lifetime.\nIn Maurice there are two books, repelling and repellent to each other, but knit together so closely that the tensions between the two are palpable. Forster famously spent much of his life working on Maurice (which was published posthumously), changing his mind several times about numerous passages, writing and rewriting large chunks. As such the dialogue and memorable scenes flow past with charm and wit, whereas the frequent internalizations---no doubt mirroring Forster's own tangled thoughts---are overwrought and dense.\nThat there is more to this book than polemic, against a society where homophobia is not merely the norm but is almost a moral compunction, is a testament to his writing skill. That Forster has---unintentionally---padded a lovely, funny book with churned-up meanderings of introspection is a shame, but inevitable. Like the better fiction Maurice is largely enjoyable and entirely readable;   like the worst of fiction, it tells you less about the lead character than about the author.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Maurice        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    E.M.

While there are many proverbial grandfathers---Mary  Shelley, Jules Verne, Stevenson, the strain of occult that pervades  pre-Victorian detective fiction---Wells took many existing strands of the  gothic and the sinister, and twisted them into a structure capable of  supporting the sudden growth of the genre in the twentieth century. He  managed to plait together three apparently irreconcilable ideas concerning  science: the optimism of the scientist, the whole of the physical world  ripe for conquering; the pessimism of the realist, who foresees the  ultimate impact of science as being negligible on the development or  indeed redemption of the human race; and the antagonism of the naturalist,  who saw science overturning the order of the universe with little  understanding of the potential consequences. All of his scientists  initially embody the first notion; the morals of The Time  Machine and The War of the Worlds might be seen to  imply the second; but The Island of Doctor Moreau is without  doubt an example of the third.\nThe narrator Prendick has found himself delivered to some Micronesian backwater after being recovered from a shipwreck, and soon discovers Moreau and his right-hand man Montgomery indulging in hideous vivisection, reshaping animals of all species to both look and behave more like men. To the two scientists their own work appears progressive and of little account, respectively. Other areas on the island have been colonized by past experiments, a society as feral as it is feudal, and governed by Moreau's mantra of the Law. In his construction of Moreau's isolated dystopia, Wells is in some ways cautioning against not merely scientific hubris, but social hubris as well. Moreau has been attempting to refashion an ecosystem in his own image, that of man: in a sense, his created community consists entirely of reminders that such homogeneous ideals as the nation state will invariably turn out dysfunctional and cryptofactional. Ironically too, although he never admits it outright, Moreau has failed in every single experiment he has conducted on the island, in both humane and practical senses: without supervision and the pervasive fear of Moreau and his \"house of pain\" the beast-men invariably become less like men and more like beasts.\nAt no point in the novel does Wells seriously attempt to engender  suspense in the reader. Although his unlikely hero Prendick speculates on,  and occasionally pre-empts his own relating of, the fall to which Moreau  is heading, this is partly little more than a gossipy confirmation  and  some of Prendick's many mental wanderings. The nature of Moreau's  experiments is confirmed matter-of-factly perhaps a third of the way into  the novel, and is only ever an explicit horror. Instead, Wells works in a  potboiler--thriller mode, similar to John Buchan, providing action and  excitement in which, against all expectations, he subtly drops ethical and  moral weights which seem to disappear from view, but nonetheless give the  novel substance and force. Wells may have hoped that the genre his child  would continue to ask philosophical questions, rendering the ethically  complex palatable with a framework of slightly silly fisticuffs and  scientification. Like many of his scientists, Wells was an incorrigible  optimist; perhaps had he himself had a time machine, he might have  felt otherwise.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Island of Doctor Moreau        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    H.

Psychologically speaking, that is. Practically speaking, her string of assignations is entirely clandestine; none of her partners, not even long-term Alan, know of the others' existence. But the balancing act she must perform every day, covering her tracks like A Spy In The House Of Love, is tearing her apart, and she reluctantly entangles herself with a professional lie detector in order to resolve her personality into a whole woman.\nSabina is, in fact, a neurotic. With the wilfulness of a psychopath she pushes herself into affair after pointless affair with one-dimensional archetypes ranging from the tanned Don Juan to the generically troubled air-force pilot, while all the time Reliable Alan acts like the short, balding foil to her Benny Hill antics. With intermittent and unreliable symbolism A Spy In The House Of Love gives the lie to its heroine's claims, and ultimately becomes an analysis of a woman who is less the representative of all women and more the sum of their fears.\nSabina may well be Anaïs Nin's idea of the Everywoman. Nin tries to build universal truths with the components of her characters' problems, and one can often (painfully) see the mortar being laid around the cornerstone of that bloody Alan. But it feels like random words, or sometimes sentences, or sometimes even paragraphs, have been omitted out of a perverse desire to sound Delphic. In this quasi-editorial massacre, that smears to unintelligibility the narrative in A Spy In The House Of Love, we are no longer able to detect any plans Nin might have had outside of becoming a bargain-basement Milan Kundera.\n  \n    \n            \n                    A Spy In The House Of Love        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anaïs Nin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2001)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/house-divided.html"},{"title":"How many gentle flowers grow","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Crome Yellow        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Aldous Huxley        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £1,999.00,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Free</a>, Gutenberg        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nCondensed to the basics of its plot, Huxley's Crome Yellow sounds more like an episode in the H.E. Bates Darling Buds franchise than a biting social satire. Denis Stone pootles over hill and dale on his bicycle, to arrive at Crome, the idyllic country house in \"the green heart of England\", not far from the mythical village of Camlet. He joins an assortment of English archetypes---the languid, pale young woman; the horsey lady of the manor; her buffoonish husband; a pink-cheeked earnest bluestocking; a troubled, tempestuous artist; a rational Brunellian technologist; a sweet-talking mercurial womanizer---to lounge about in their little world, listen to some family history, attend a fête, and fall prey to charming misunderstandings.\nIf the happenings sound inconsequential, it's because they are; and, with Huxley's writing, if they are, then they're meant to be. Not only does the novel draw energy from such small ironic paradoxes, but the very pointlessness of life for Denis, Anne, Priscilla and the rest is simultaneously a dig at their social stratum and a conveniently anonymous prop on which to base any number of subtle character sketches. As Denis with his pretensions to poet angsts and wrangles his way through his internal life, the opinions, mores and beliefs of his era are lifted one by one for examination in the summer sunlight, and hung up for exhibition, like bunting between the supports of the cake tent.\nHuxley's years spent in a country manor are far more conducive to his muse than the metropolitan set that inspired Antic Hay. In Crome Yellow Huxley has written a novel both of its time and of any time. The middle-class farce it evokes is taking place even now, and the elements that have lapsed still deserve just as much satirizing to prevent nostalgia setting in. Suiting its internal contrasts and ironies, this is an important novel masquerading as a trivial one, and it proves as easy to read as it is hard to put down.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Crome Yellow        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Aldous Huxley        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £1,999.00,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Free</a>, Gutenberg        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/how-many-gentle-flowers-grow.html"},{"title":"I change, but in death","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Kalki        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Gore Vidal        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £9.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nJames Kelly wants to bring about the end of the world. In the guise of Kalki, the final avatar of Vishnu, that's precisely what he will do. But why? If Kelly really believes himself to be a god, that question is more complex than it appears; if he's bluffing, and the government's investigations into his all-too-human history of drug dealing and post-Vietnam activities have revealed the truth, then the question and its answer are more straightforward. Few people dare to think of the third possibility: that Kalki is really among us, and the end is as nigh as he, or maybe He, claims.\nEnter Theodora Ottinger, flying ace and largely failed mother. The glow surrounding her memoir Beyond Motherhood has largely faded, and the alimony payments are due. Just in time, word reaches her that Kalki wants her to interview him, and will accept no other: until, of course, an interview with CBS scheduled for a week or two later. But what, apart from sex and the distribution of his origami peace flowers to all nations, does Kalki want with the stridently bisexual Ottinger? And what, apart from sex and a good story, attracts her to Kalki and others in his coterie? How might all these dysfunctional, possibly deified individuals depend upon each other? And what does it mean to the rest of the world---for the next month or so, at least?\nVidal understands his genre well: in this as in other novels, he combines noirish suspense with a soap-operatic absurdity that turns comedy tragic at the same time as turning tragedy comic. Ottinger's journeys and her plane flights are at the same time a shambolic gamble on her own mortality and a purposeful, insightful investigation of the tendrils of Kalki's international organizations. The book's general atmosphere also remains timely, describing the 1980s American dystopia in a way that chimes far more eerily with the circumstances of our new century: a weakened, tottering American empire, set like shit on a rock in a decaying, dangerously unstable climate; bleached, poisoned, beset by other world powers it feels far too certain it can control; and ploughing on regardless into its own oblivion, with or without the help of the Destroyer of Foulness.\nIn keeping with the suspenseful style of the narration---from Ottinger's point of view---the book is riveting and complex. Vidal has proved himself time and again as one of America's foremost writers: a master of style, searingly intelligent and with an acidic, biting sense of satire (one daren't call it humour) that could etch any politico to the bone. His status as an author, however, is more easily contested. Vidal finds it hard to distance himself from his subject, and his voice often creeps into those of his characters. When Ottinger creeps too far into political comment, or when her stream of consciousness freewheels through philosophy or psychology, one can hear the rumbling, crackling tones of the author turning her charming, rich voice into a brief succession of bum notes. But in Kalki more than in other novels Vidal is capable of largely forgetting himself, and his own prejudices, and reconciling himself with his varied and generally sympathetic characters. Just as well he and they are able to set aside their differences: after all, life is too short to fall out; brutally short.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Kalki        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Gore Vidal        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £9.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/i-change-death.html"},{"title":"I want you to do me a favour","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Last Orders        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Swift        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, Dec 9, 2005, and on the ReadReverb website)\nFamily butcher, hard drinker, self-styled patriarch of his little local clique: it's not for Bermondsey's Jack Dodds to go gentle into that good night. But even he wouldn't have expected his drinking mates to turn the long journey with his ashes to Margate into a tour of the furthest reaches of south-east England. There's the gambler, the fighter, the undertaker and the car dealer (who's Jack's son and yet not Jack's son); but where's Amy, Jack's long-suffering? Who's she going to visit instead, and why would Jack never acknowledge their existence? What's the big mystery of the camper van, and why would a man on his death-bed need a thousand pounds in cash? Did he really take it all with him?\nOnce again Swift has written a book which is as much about the English countryside as about its main players. Jack's final journey takes us through Kent (the garden of England, as we're often reminded), and almost everyone gets a chance to tell a section or two from their point of view. Through this multiplicity of voices little histories are made to hang off the big geography like beads off a rosary: a war memorial in Chatham rubs shoulders with hop fields on the south coast; the Black Prince makes a guest appearance; and horses gallop from Chepstow to Towcester, carrying the fortunes of everyone, not just Lucky Raysy. Mud, soil, sand and spray are all churned up and flung at the reader.\nThe plot is almost entirely played out by setting conflicting narratives against each other. Half a dozen people can tell the reader half a dozen different lies, and by assembling this patchwork one can work out what's really happened. Sometimes the book-length warps of Last Orders are in danger of being smothered by this blanket of voices, but Swift is endlessly picking up the weft and pulling it in a new direction, and it turns out that nothing is ever truly lost: not the thread, nor the plot, nor the point, nor the characters' own personal freedoms. Not even Jack, as at the hands of his friends he slowly becomes part of first this field and then that patch of sea...

Who is the victim and who is the perpetrator? Is there an innocent bystander, an unsuspecting accomplice, or a selfish socipath in their midst? Can any one character ever be described in such extremes, when everyone might be guilty or blameless to some degree? Julian Barnes attempts to answer, or at any rate pose, these questions in Talking it Over. His three narrators all speak in the first person, discussing their own versions of events, their reactions and calculations, and their readings of each other's experiences: the last, with varying degrees of accuracy.\nIt's an an illuminating portrayal of three incomplete personalities which, while forming a whole that's just a little too big for the comfort of its component parts, would be unstable with any piece missing. But this method of contrasting first-hand accounts, while illuminating, has its own risks. Lengthy internal monologues have difficulties retaining emotional ambiguity. James Joyce and Mark Haddon both triumphed over the internal monologue's literalization and crystallization of emotion: the one by sly, ungrammatical undercurrents of id; the other by the transformation of an emotional dysfunction into emotional tension. But while Barnes effortlessly causes the reader's sympathy to move from one character to the next, by revealing some event or motivation that was never suspected, he nonetheless pins the sympathy in place after each move. We are in no doubt, on any given page, about who we should be rooting for, exactly how they are feeling and who is at fault; when the scene rearranges it quickly clears once more.\nThe characters, for all their development and internal coherence, often feel like two-tiered constructs, their structure designed specifically to illuminate the difference between how their outer surfaces are perceived and how their inner selves suffer. And there's much that Barnes doesn't address here that Beckett's Endgame covers admirably, even if Barnes is far more accessible. Still, Talking it Over is written with Barnes' typical and accomplished skill for characters and dialogue, and an attention to detail that serves him well as---almost as editor of these three personal accounts---he juxtaposes opinion with opinion so as to try to approach the truth. Whatever that might be.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Talking it Over        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Julian Barnes        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1992)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/its-good-talk.html"},{"title":"The kitsching of the prevalent","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Pedant in the Kitchen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Julian Barnes        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Atlantic        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nCookery columns are cool. Just ask Alex Kapranos of art-indie band Franz Ferdinand, who wrote a number of articles for the Guardian about what he ate while touring. Fellow reluctant Guardian foodie (and much more besides) Julian Barnes wrote a series of similar pieces, with the theme of how the reluctant, easily confused newcomer deals with existing books on cookery, the specifics of ingredients and utensils, and the general hilarity which a fool and a pan can invoke. The resulting collection, novella-length, is gently and rather casually written, like the writings of James Fenton (another Guardianista) who Barnes cites. There are quasi-subversive references to the Big Mac and the Martha Stewart, and the now obligatory debunking of the myth of Mrs Beeton. Generally, though, Barnes' confusion and wide-eyed amateurish fear is almost entirely sympathetic, and really quite funny. The book has a warm humour and an unthreatening charm that makes you wonder just how far Barnes has moved from the axis of Amis and Swift he once happily and edgily sat upon.\nAn illuminating if unexpected companion piece to The Pedant would probably be one of Jeremy Clarkson's recent bound diatribes. Both authors have a unique tone and a recalcitrant fanbase who are more than happy to read anything written in the genre. Both authors write as prisoners of powerful, ubiquitous systems, the political views of which are anathema to the writers themselves: Clarkson sees wet liberals everywhere in society, restricting the freedoms of honest white male car-owning well-off folk; Barnes' kitchen library is full of passive-aggressive authoritarian Tories, keen to maintain a Victorian culinary status quo and refusing to provide him with information precise enough to liberate him from the bondage of novicehood. Both then proceed to rail against these systems: Clarkson in his witless, anti-intellectual \"common-sense\" bombast, Barnes in an overanalytical, weedy, self-undermining whine.\nAnd both, ultimately, are unwilling to resort to any action that might bring about the revolutions for which they seem to be longing. Both are happy to complain, berate, hold up for mockery and generally work themselves into emotional froths, so long as it gains them the audiences they crave. Their personal bêtes noires are also their vaches de cash, and to actually slay them would be financial and---if you like---artistic folly. Instead, they happily perpetuate the systems with which they have vitriolic, dysfunctional but ultimately lucrative relationships. Still, that's life. Or, more pedantically, that's entertainment.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Pedant in the Kitchen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Julian Barnes        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Atlantic        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/kitsching-prevalent.html"},{"title":"The knight is darkest in this new dawn","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Frank Miller        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £14.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Titan        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, Nov 11, 2005, and on the ReadReverb  website)\n\"What happened to them? Where are they? Where are our heroes?\" cries Jimmy Olsen, now veteran reporter at the Daily Planet, at the start of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Strikes Again. What has happened to them? While the eponymous knight has been in exile, presumed dead, Lex Luthor and Brainiac have wrested control of the planet from its democratic governments, and the Freedom From Information Act and a hologrammatic president support their every move. Even the Justice League—the sorry, remaining superhuman trio—are in their thrall. Who dares to free mankind?\nThis, the sequel to Frank Miller's earlier work Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, is both a departure from the graphic novel's current trend and a return to its roots. Bombastic, technicolor, graphic in more ways than one, it was originally subtitled DK2 as a wry nod to the trend of art-house classics spawning explosive if shallower sequels, packed with special effects and a star-studded cast: DK2 can boast such one-time news-stand regulars as The Atom, The Flash, Green Arrow. While the heroes look like heroes, the humans look, well, sub-human: cartoony, big-headed and less realistic than those wearing the tights. But none of this should be considered disparaging: the Dark Knight is still intelligent, thoughtful, multilayered and complex; only now there's no more time to analyse and consider, only time to act. And we are happily dragged along on the roller-coaster, through page after page after page.\nIndeed, in The Dark Knight Strikes Back we see the completion of a journey begun in part with the seminal 1987 Watchmen by Alan Moore. The first Dark Knight novel succeeded in blurring the traditional boundaries like never before: human, everyday stories interspersing the action; grim plotlines and realizations, and no easy answers to the questions it posed. In the final step, this sequel, we actually see the resilience of the graphic novel, even to the intellectual fashions that Moore and Miller impose upon it. The medium has nurtured Moore's irony, ambiguity, self-reflexivity and self-pastiche, and then happily absorbed it: understood it, studied it, but ultimately moved on. With its increased musculature and an enhanced self-knowledge, the genre can now walk tall once again, safe in the knowledge that anything the written word can do, it can do just as well. Between them, Miller and Moore have reminded us that a giant indeed walks the earth.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Frank Miller        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £14.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Titan        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/knight-darkest-new-dawn.html"},{"title":"The land of the setting sun","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Long Day Wanes        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1981)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe British empire is on the retreat. Finally accepting that the complexity of Eastern society is a puzzle they will never solve, the massed ranks of Western officialdom are starting to pull up sticks and book their flights home. Victor Crabbe, and his eventual acquaintances Nabby Adams and Rupert Hardman are in the process of becoming anachronisms; although Crabbe is the only one to fully perceive it, he nonetheless clings the most doggedly to the evolving Malayan state. While the Malays, Tamils, Chinese and Muslims perform a vicious dance together, of accusations, fights and simmering revolution, Crabbe is hoping he can stay on long enough to help the indigenous peoples solve that puzzle for themselves. But how can Crabbe save the remnants of bureaucracy that might help to bring forth a nascent Malaya, when he has trouble saving his own career, marriage or sobriety? Through education, and a national symphony...?\nMuch is autobiographical about Burgess' sprawling cycle of books, originally published as A Malayan Trilogy. Burgess was a teacher; he spent a lot of his life in the east; his marriage had its ups and downs, and his first wife her alcoholic, dissipated spells. Indeed, much of the colour of this book is clearly first-hand: vivid, although with an inevitable touch of colonialism, it brings all the characters fully, utterly to life. Many of them are at least in part stereotypes of their race, but in the volatile environment of the Malayan peninsula at that time it's easy to believe that people would return to the values of the cultures they grew up with, entrenching racial divides at the expense of national unity. Moreover, in every case the stereotype typically forms only a tiny fraction of each portrait, like a vague political allegiance rather than the main drive of the personality. Burgess has developed the individuality of each person to the point where it completely swamps the moulds that originally formed their shapes: the inscrutable Chinese are either Britain-spoiled chortling aesthetes or confused, hair-tearing adolescent geniuses; the devout Muslims all take part in haram to varying extents, sometimes partying and mingling with the British; they in turn are neurotic and tortured, or gushing and well-meaning, scarcely ever bluff or stiffened of upper lip.\nSuch depth of character is very much welcome, because the plot of the trilogy might as well not be there. Events just sort of happen to people, and any attempt to take matters into their own hands leads them more often then not to minor perditions. It might be said that, certainly for Crabbe, external politics move him from place to place and advance the book, but one feels that the precise opposite happening would, as far as Burgess is concerned, suit the course of the novels just as well. It's this pointlessness, this lack of a teleology, that makes the books so convincingly realistic. A polemic, or a more surgical dissection of the mistakes and bad judgment that took part in the formation of the Federation of Malaya, might have served Burgess' cause more fully, but it's not entirely clear what he was pursuing with these novels (if anything more than his own career). However you interpret his political stance and the success of its communication, though, there's no doubting that he brings a transitional, forgotten world to life; if the remnants of the empire include the humanity of Crabbe and others, then it cannot have wholly failed.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Long Day Wanes        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1981)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/land-setting-sun.html"},{"title":"From laughable, comic to graphic, novel","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Watchmen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alan Moore        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £14.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Titan        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWatchmen, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: The  Dark Knight Strikes Back, by Alan Moore and Frank Miller\n\n   \n   \n   \n\n\"What happened to them? Where are they? Where are our heroes?\" cries Jimmy Olsen, now veteran reporter at the Daily Planet, at the start of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Strikes Again. What has happened to them? All of the ones in these three books are suffering mid-life crises.  Alan Moore's own creations, the ageing remnants of the vigilante group Watchmen, are combing their widow's peaks and obsessing about their parentage, their paunches, their erectile dysfunction and occasionally the odd crime or two. Meanwhile, Miller turns the golden years of the legendary Batman inside out, as all of Bruce's old certainties come crashing down and the world begins slowly, hectoringly, to reject its onetime saviour. And when the Dark Knight finally returns from a self-imposed exile, Lex Luthor and Brainiac are in charge of everything, and the Justice League are in their thrall. \"We must not remind them,\" Superman says of mere humans, \"that giants walk the earth.\" But what if the giants are their only hope?\nThe comic was arguably raised to the art form of \"graphic novel\" by a whole pantheon of contributors, including Garth Ennis, Grant Morrison, and Neil Gaiman who, with his Sandman series, showed that comics could be beautiful, have complications, contain multitudes. But Gaiman's work was still arguably a comprehensive cleaning-up of comics, rather than a stretching of the medium beyond any of its existing limits. Although Sandman was ingenious in the way it metatextualized any and every mythology you could think of, it still told remarkably straight fairy stories, however well. In the mean time, though, Moore's 1987 classic Watchmen had already pointed the graphic novel in a whole new direction: tortuous self-doubt, both within the story and the genre itself.\nWhile others were asking whether the comic could be something so much more reputable (a question that he had already answered to himself in the affirmative) Moore instead took as his starting point: what if the world is sick of comic-book heroes? How can the comic tell the story of when the muscles start to sag, the spandex tights are no longer tight, and everyone's fed up with crypto-rightwing molly-coddlers masquerading as freedom-loving ultra-libertarians and saving the day all the damn time? Dare it even tell such a story? Boldly, Watchmen began from this premise, and blossomed miraculously in all directions.\nWhere one might think comics could never really take root---beyond the reach of the zap, the biff and the pow---they actually found their most fertile soil yet. When a Watchman-turned-gun-for-hire is thrown out of a tall building, the remaining (and long-since outlawed) Watchman tries to round up the team he once felt he could rely upon. But time is running out: who is pulling the strings? Who is killing the masked men? Even Doctor Manhattan---immortal, blue, freak of accident and the only genuine superhuman in the book---is powerless in the face of... something, that not even he can foresee.\nThis seminal work has aged reasonably well; yet it's clear that, its subtlety is a largely unsubtle subtlety. The same leitmotive are played again and again---look out for the \"besmirched circle\", appearing as a smiley face with a drop of blood, a goggle lens covered in dust or the sunrise through a smeared window---and the plot, while complex, has a jet-black irony at the core of it rather than any moral ambiguity. The only questions remaining are not \"was such an act good or evil?\" but rather \"did you agree with it? did it do the global trick?\": in effect, politics rather than ethics.\nIt took Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns to provide us with shades of grey and, with its beautiful, quiet, relatively photorealistic artwork, yield the apotheosis of the self-deconstructing comic-hero myth. This was the high water-mark, where the genre finally adopted ambiguity, irony and self-pastiche in its very core, as badges of pride, both in the legacy of material that (for better or worse) supports the modern-day comic and in the way that comics must henceforth treat their stories.\nBruce Wayne is in his fifties and effectively retired: a smart, wise, well-built middle-aged man. But the city he once protected is in slow collapse, and cries out for the Batman in high-pitched screams that only he can hear. And so he dons the cape once more, fighting all the old villains and finally putting demon after demon to rest, in one way or another. But the president---an ageing, Ronald Reagan lookalike---is wary of this old buck from Gotham, and decides to send in his most crack of troops, a somewhat older buck from Metropolis, who has made a deal with the establishment in order to keep saving lives on the quiet. Now, if only the Soviets can be prevented from launching missile attacks at the USA for long enough, then the problem of Batman can soon be dealt with.\nFrom the very beginning of The Dark Knight Returns we are subjected to a kaleidoscope of conflicting opinions, news reports, sound bites. Is Batman fighting crime or encouraging it, as the Joker kills knowing full well that Batman is keeping a body-count?  The psychological clap-trap (and its clap-trappers) who free first Two-Face and then the Joker are parodied, yes: but so, in a quiet way, is Commissioner Gordon, taking the expected lock-em-up stance of the ageing policeman. While he's eventually vindicated by both of their actions, it's not clear whether such empirical justification is sufficient moral justification. Indeed, it's never made clear. Nothing is clear in this novel, not even the art work: dusty, cloudy, semi-darkness pervades all but the brightest explosions, in a stark contrast to Watchmen's use of primary colours. Ambiguity of form and ambiguity of content have come together, and have fused into this smoky, multifaceted gem.\nSo it's all the more surprising that, five years on, The Dark Knight Strikes Back marks in so many ways a return to the more obvious irony of Watchmen, and the straighter storytelling of even earlier comics. Although Miller is still employing all his techniques of blending the action with (now) more modern media and sources of commentary, and there are still at least half a dozen plot lines at work, with the climactic scenes barely anticipated ten pages beforehand, this novel has all its stops pulled out, and screams along from start to finish with the reader breathlessly in tow. No time to dwell on good and evil: Batman, and a number of other superheroes including The Flash and The Atom, have only time to act.\nWhereas The Dark Knight Returns portrays superheroes as more well-sculpted versions of ordinary men, in the sequel all but the heroes are portrayed as, well, sub-human, squat, comic-strip beings, with large heads and manga eyes. Outside the ranks of this novel's stars and celebrities, we are truly in The Boondocks, or even the backyard of Calvin & Hobbes. Granted, a darker, nastier version of either of those; but the nods and winks to traditional styles of drawing are implemented more often than just in passing. The untermensch matter little in this novel except as spectators and agents; the news feeds advance the plot; Superman gets the shit kicked out of him a number of times but we understand that particular emotional trick now. The Dark Knight Returns is bombastic and strong. It belongs to a new generation that has seen the lyrical, tangled work of its predecessors, and learnt from it, even if that only means learning what's been done so that it isn't repeated.\nMore than anything else, The Dark Knight Strikes Back shows us the resilience of the graphic novel to the fashions that beset it, however energising and ultimately healthy those trends might be. The medium has nurtured Miller's earlier style, shaped it, polished it, released it into the world... and then happily absorbed it; understood it, studied it, but ultimately moved on, returned in part to its roots but never completing the circle; rather, transcribing an awkward, ungainly helix towards somewhere entirely different and unpredictable. This is is the rollicking blockbuster sequel to the art-house classic---Miller originally called it DK2 as a pastiche of the then rash of such sequels---but with its increased musculature and an enhanced proprioception the genre can now walk tall once again, safe in the knowledge that anything the written word can do, it can do just as well. Between them, Miller and Moore have reminded us that a giant indeed walks the earth.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Watchmen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alan Moore        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £14.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Titan        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/laughable-comic-graphic-novel.html"},{"title":"Let the dead describe their own dead","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Aspern Papers        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Henry James        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Free        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Gutenberg        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nJeffrey Aspern was a world-class poet, and as such attracted a gaggle  of biographers shortly after his death, all clamouring to tell the  definitive story of the great man. The narrator of James' The Aspern  Papers is one such devotee---or hack, depending on your  point of view. He travels to Venice to hoodwink two generations of ageing  Aspern-satellites into yielding the papers that he is certain the elder  has hidden. Inveigling himself in their household as a lodger, he worries  away at the younger woman but ends up too deeply involved in the  household, tempting the onset of the older woman's ill health as she  begins to suspect his motives. Worse still is the prospect he finds  inconceivable: failure to procure Aspern's papers.\nJames' convoluted, ornate style is ideally suited to this sort of work,  conjuring as it can tension and suspense out of the most apparently  innocent of situations. His circumlocutions appear to orbit subjects  which, when talked of directly, might be innocent enough; seen from the  corner of the eye they take on an altogether sinister object, as is also  clear from his other novella The Turn of the Screw. James'  writing is at once tangled and wandering, yet is still dense and tight:  like certain mathematical maze forms, his verbal journey fills every  single nook and corner of the space allotted. James is able to turn what  might be a rather banal tale of the hunter-gathering of a dead author's  papers from two unsympathetic old women into a novel of tension that makes  the reader's nerves twang and jangle with the effort of reading.\nNot only that, but James is able to cover so much ground with his  method that almost every aspect of this novel is practically overdeveloped  to the point of giantism. We get rich, intricate descriptions of the  atmosphere and aspect of Venice almost as asides; the two women are  compared and contrasted until each becomes as three-dimensional as the  lone subject of almost any full-length novel; and we see in the narrator  the conflict between James' own horror of the vultures that might circle  his still-warm body and his sense of his own literary duty. Indeed, there  seem to be even more likenesses between author and narrator than are made  explicit, as the protagonist, fresh from the male-oriented environment of  hinted-at academic institutions, shies away from a marriage proposal as a  means to his concealed ends: deified, unattainable Aspern is the only  object of his desires. Ultimately, though, we find in The Aspern  Papers a novella of complexity in all forms: thoughtful, careful  and brilliant.

But, while the reincarnated occasionally attempt to make contact with their onetime relatives, reality itself seems subject to the whims of a parade of pulp novelists: aliens land in the city; a statuesque blonde policewoman sexes her way through the barrios; and the high society of Duluth, led by magnate Bellamy Craig, drug-dealer Big John and shadowy figure The Dude, attempt to subvert and control the rioting masses. And when the spaceship seems to move wherever the sheriff puts the drawing pin on his map, or when famous novelist Rosemary Klein Kantor uses her database of everyone else's fiction to change the social and geographical landscapes of the town, it's clear that not all of the problems can be laid squarely at the door of Mayor Herridge.\nThis is a novel about the power of fiction as much as it's a social satire. It boasts special effects and complicated visual sequences alongside such typical necessities as plot and characterization. As such, it suffers occasionally under the weight of the explosives and machinery required to keep the fires and bullets stoked, and the alien spacecraft moving around by pomo-magic. Vidal's typically acerbic malice is here so flamboyant and over the top that it occasionally reveals the puppetry that guides his protagonists in their roles. Shallowness of character is not something that one expects from a Vidal novel and, while a brief managing of expectations permits you to settle down and simply watch the show, in the interim it's easy to feel lost among a carnival of exciting, but ultimately pointless, distractions: \"is this all there is?\"\nRather aptly, then, Duluth is one of a breed of novels (all kissing-cousins of Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions) that express a kind of mid-life crisis both in the lives of the individual authors and also in the way that the novel can be written. Personal and technical fears go into the writing of such books, and it's understandable that excesses of style and technique are to be found in what are, in some ways, attempts to fend off insecurity. That Calvino was a fan of Duluth reveals a lot about its content: it's a novelist's novel, pointing the way for all sorts of techniques, but ultimately, like Captain Eddie standing for mayor but messing with his maps and plans, too busy with prestidigitation to win the popular vote.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Duluth        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Gore Vidal        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1976)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/life-duluth-bits-left.html"},{"title":"Life has no message: only mess","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Death of Vishnu        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Manil Suri        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Bloomsbury        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2002)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nIf you want a novel which wilfully mystifies far-off places to make the middle classes think their reading tastes are exotic—think by authors like McCall Smith—then look for one whose quoted reviews talk of \"characters smell[ing] of cardamom and clove.\" Such books wear their broadmindedness heavily, patronising reader and subject alike, adding layers of sensual description until there remain no hard edges. in the story. Even native authors are not immune, so it's a relief to find, after Meera Syal's comments on the back of the book, that Suri's inventions actually smell of body odour, fear, tobacco and worse: Vishnu has soiled himself before the end of the first page. And the cast of The Death of Vishnu live their lives through prose so bare and unpurpled that*#x2014;blissfully—at times the barrier of the printed page is almost invisible.\nVishnu's gradual decline, afflicted as he is by an illness too costly for the other characters—residents on the staircase for which he is the half-hearted, incidental caretaker—to treat, prompts flashbacks to the past and hallucinations in the present. On the rickety structure of a dying man's feverish thoughts hangs the rest of the novel: the lives of the other residents; their romantic, comedic, tragic or tawdry pasts; their intrigues and scheming with or against each other. \nIs Vishnu transcending his body, to walk among them while he also lies on the stairs in a fever? Or does he dream his own ascendence, from storey to storey, towards what he imagines to be his fellow gods? No matter, as his knight's tour of the many rooms permits revelations about others, just as his own life is revealed through reminiscence. Meanwhile, the stories and plots accrete and silt upon each other, rather than being constructed, from page to page. Accumulating in this way, many are ultimately untidy and incomplete: whether a story resolves or not; whether a grief is fully assuaged or remains raw; whether a goal of social advancement is achieved, thwarted, or merely chased from chapter to chapter; seems entirely coincidental. Only Vishnu's personal arc properly finishes its span, far beyond life and death.\nMaybe that's the point: that other people's stories are always partly ineffable, half finished or half begun with no concern of our own coming or going in the narrative. We pretend others' lives can be neatly framed by the novel—indeed, Vishnu's dying brain tries and ultimately fails to frame his own life as a film, watched by one-time lover Padmini—but only bear full witness to the full cycle of our own. Syal was right, at least, to say that The Death of Vishnu is \"a love letter to Bombay and its people;\" but what that letter really says to the beloved, we outsiders can only hope to overhear.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Death of Vishnu        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Manil Suri        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Bloomsbury        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2002)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/life-has-no-message-only-mess.html"},{"title":"Life's what you make it","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Crying of Lot 49        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Thomas Pynchon        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nOedipa Maas is executor of her ex-lover's will, only she's stumbled upon a centuries-old conspiracy, only in doing so she might actually be following the unwritten desires of dead Pierce Inverarity after all.

Philatelist Genghis Cohen and ex-Buchenwalder Dr Hilarius give her hints but actor Driblette holds the key, or is it with beatnik Mike Fallopian or even seventeenth century playwright Richard Wharfinger? Behind the real and cardboard scenes, Trystero's network of illegal postal employees waits, bides its time, provides a service for the disaffected dropouts and the suicidal... or does it exist at all?\nFrank Kermode, with his usual extremity of reaction (a trait I heartily admire), called Lot 49 \"the best American novel I have read since the war\". Such Leavisite evangelism suggests he's been neglecting a lot of other books. But Lot 49 is undeniably powerful, powerful with that graceful ease and poise that ballet dancers spend a lifetime perfecting. The dizzying car-crash of verbal gags, sinister happenings and bizarre all-American characters do suggest that somewhere in this rich fruit-cake mess is hidden the Great American Shilling.\nIt's gorgeous to read, once the emetic splurge of the first chapter has settled down into a relaxed, swinging stride of dialogue to rival DeLillo, streams of consciousness and event that would raise an Irish eyebrow or two, and significations that Eco would kill for. And all the ideas and events in Lot 49 are so loosely, casually tied together that almost any (re)interpretation can be laid over them. Look on the web and see that everyone's done it: it's a hallucination, it's an allegory of the Nixon era, of McCarthyism, of the Cold War, it's meant to be real, it's a conspiracy against Oedipa, her lover has faked his death and is pulling all the strings....\nAnd the twist is that none of these interpretations matter as much as the novel's polymorphism. The recasting of reality as imaginings and back again is an old trick of such stalwarts as Philip K Dick, but while Dick convolves he also makes apparent the layers he is playing with: only Pynchon can convinces you that maybe he doesn't mean it, or doesn't care, or it's all throwaway, or it's all entirely earnest and pointed and he means it after all. Like the spin of a roulette wheel, where this all stops Pynchon only knows and---reclusive, shy, and probably directing his post through other means---he ain't telling.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Crying of Lot 49        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Thomas Pynchon        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/lifes-what-you-make-it.html"},{"title":"Looking for a good idea","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    My Idea of Fun        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Will Self        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThere's something wrong with Ian Wharton. His idea of fun is a bit, well... let's just say it's probably not the same as yours. He's a bit unstable and pretty introverted; but then you might be too, if you could conjure up an internal, eidetic universe and fly through it at will, peeking into the dorms at Roedean and stealing watches from people's pockets, all in the blink of an eye. And The Fat Controller isn't helping matters, teaching him the secrets of the universe and how to cure his spots with alchemy, while killing theatre-goers with a curare-tipped hypodermic. So when Dr Gyggle steps in with some empiricism-as-therapy, Ian thinks it's for the best; but the little devil at the controls of his  brain hopes that things will get far, far worse.\nForget everything you've heard about Self's verbosity and pretentiousness: when he gets to work he crackles and flexes with energy, and you can see the muscles rippling under the surface. He's thrilling and relentless, and can turn a quirky, back-of-the-bookshop theme into something with the emotional weight of a legal blockbuster.\nSo why is this outing so unsatisfying?\nMy Idea of Fun is subtitled \"A Cautionary Tale\", but is Self paying attention? He's cut free of what's typically sneered at as \"conventional morality\": no fault in itself, but Self lazily fills the gap with the modern, meaty, bloody equivalent of good-guy-duels-with-bad-guy, which is to say guy-butchers-guy. It's no exaggeration to say that, when the narrator offhandedly mentions that he once tore off a tramp's head on an empty tube train and fucked the stump of the neck (I might as well let you in on that one: it happens two pages in and sets the tone for much of the novel) he's both defining and succumbing to a recurring theme in literary circles, work which shocks above all else.\nSelf-as-author and Ian-as-narrator both seem to follow parallel courses along a universal myth of \"amoral aesthetic leading to oblivion\": first we move through excess, then disgust, then blandness and finally to something utterly, inexplicably boring in its blatant attempts to provoke.   What a writer, though: how supple, how lithe.... A shame all he's doing is prancing round at the gym.\n  \n    \n            \n                    My Idea of Fun        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Will Self        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/looking-good-idea.html"},{"title":"Love-sick","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Gallowglass        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Barbara Vine        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1990)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nJoe is Sandor's. When Joe leapt towards the tracks that lay before an oncoming tube train, Sandor pulled him back as much with his personality as with his hands. With a past that manages to fit Italian kidnappings and a typical suburban childhood side by narrative side, Sandor is a mystery to Joe, who informs the reader of the plans that Sandor grudgingly reveals to him; but none of that matters to Joe. Joe wants, needs to be Sandor's servant. He loves Sandor, and Sandor, he knows, loves him too. Who else could he love?\nA tale told by an idiot, full of Sandor's fury, signifying nothing: morally, at any rate. Vine (alias Ruth Rendell), like Patricia Highsmith, knows how to make the reader empathize for what at first glance always seem like barely human creatures. And although Joe's resolute ignorance of Sandor's true motives (and his sometimes everyday meanness) cloys after a while, it should probably be read more as the blindness of the most definitely love-sick. One ought to think: despite his violent upbringing, Joe is not so much backward as wrapped in the blurring fog of his depression; nonetheless, by the middle of the book (a testament to the author) Sandor's character is clear as day to the reader, and it ought to be clear to Joe. Can Joe be simultaneously this unaware plot-cipher and still provoke an emotional response from us?\nBut this is a niggle, noticed more in retrospect than in the reading. Gallowglass is a well-written, clever, exciting page-turner. It provides a frighteningly detailed description of twisted love arising from twisted circumstances but being no shallower an emotion for all that. At times it almost feels as though this was what the thriller form was built for, revealing these perfect imperfections.

A humble everyman who struggles to make ends meet and divert if not defuse the anger of his manager, his minor mishaps and even smaller triumphs are charted in this collection of short stories. Each takes place in one of the four seasons over what might be several years, each a in Marcovaldo's undramatic drama. And loveable Marcovaldo, with his empathy for everything that rarely translates into a useful discourse with anyone, leads the reader by the hand and heart through his world.\nCalvino uses Marcovaldo's peasantry as a brush to daub the countryside on the city where Marcovaldo is unwittingly trapped. Marcovaldo's naïvety ridicules these crazy city folk---disease scares, consumerism, the abandonment of streets in August---yet Calvino never portrays the alternatives as some saccharine Arcady. Marcovaldo becomes a force of nature, timeless and ageless like the creation myth or Charlie Brown; as he passes through the seasons, these could be any seasons, any years. When Marcovaldo fools about in the snow, he is careering and japing through every snow flurry there ever was: though there are the occasional mentions of cars in the English translation, these are almost always inert and lifeless, scenery that does not detract from the story's universality.\nThis trick of all-encompassment leads to some aimless stories. For every couple of lovely tales---the infected rabbit, or the out-of-control office plants---there is a throwaway one that reveals little while being neither gripping nor particularly heartwarming. Sometimes, apart from the sheer joy of the meandering words and description, it's never clear whether there's a point to the story. But, on one level, who cares? Get off that tram; reclaim the rooftops; gather in the streets; head away from here. And wherever you end up: follow Marcovaldo.

Made more mysterious by his pseudonym (curiously not yet derided as the expansion of Iain M. Banks' name has been) and the posthumous destruction of his notebooks by his widow, the Cordwainer myth is in danger of eclipsing his work altogether.\nThis is unfortunate, as a brief reading of Smith's stunning SF work shows. The Rediscovery of Man is an anthology of a number of his short stories. Drawing on the style of Chinese legend---learnt during his formative years with his father, legal advisor to Sun Yat-sen---Smith builds into his stories a timelessness and a depth of human emotion and character rare in such stories. His characters, more than his plot devices or technical specifications, leap from the pages and begin to tell you the story themselves.\nThe shorts are occasionally variable in quality, and where Smith most obviously borrows from Chinese myth (The Dead Lady of Clown Town and The Ballad of Lost C'mell, and the opening paragraphs to other stories) he loses his own voice: the nuts and bolts start to show at these points, and the reader is briefly lost as form and content begin to come apart. This aside, though, Smith's style is stunning and has a brevity whose loss, in the face of infodumps and pedestrian Gibsonisms, is to be mourned.\nMuch is made of Smith's self-consistent universe which spans millennia of history (and the ashes of all those notebooks). Again, this seems to be missing the point: plenty of great authors haven't seen the need to invent whole other universes, and it's unclear why relentless comparisons of the size, scope, shape or logic of such plans leads to universe envy among so many practitioners of Smith's genre. Rather, Smith succeeds because he winds a thread through his imagined history, and ultimately does not ruminate on imagined events, but on the human reaction to these: the commonality of rumination, leading the race of man to its rediscovery.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Rediscovery of Man        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Cordwainer Smith        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Gollancz        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/man-plain-view.html"},{"title":"As a man thinketh in his heart","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Under the Net        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Iris Murdoch        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2002)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, Nov 27, 2005, and on the ReadReverb website)\nCan a debut novel be any more self-consciously intellectual? Murdoch burst onto the literary scene with Under The Net over fifty years ago, a book whose primary inspiration was philosophy, both as a taught subject and as a wellspring for ethical exploration, discussion and action. Is it possible to fashion an enjoyable novel out of the (at first sight) heavy, unyielding materials of existentialism and Platonic realism? Murdoch answers this question with a resounding yes, in the form of a cross between an Ealing comedy, a Chesterton mystery and a Wodehouse farce which far surpasses the sum of its genre parts.\nThe protagonist, Jake Donaghue, is a not-quite-failed hack, translator and author, who meanders rather than hurtles from one pecuniary crisis to the next. Turfed out of Magda's apartment with his foil, Finn, he plans to move in chez philosophy lecturer Dave, but instead finds himself embroiled in a bizarre mixture of plot and counterplot, all revolving around his old flame Anna, onetime mentor (and innate philosopher) Hugo Belfounder, and Jake's translation of a work by a little-known French writer. Just when the plot seems as complicated as it can get---when he's stolen the canine filmstar Mister Mars and prompted Hugo to blow a hole in the side of his own film studio to escape from a Communist meeting raided by the police---a telegram arrives from Paris, and the reader must begin to be confused all over again.\nGiven the premise implies dense, unreadable wordiness, it's a surprise to find this book refreshing, exciting, humorous and even, occasionally, thrilling. Interestingly, although Donaghue often ponders a little too deeply---almost onanistically, especially during a particularly affected scene which actually turns out to be the early stage of a drunken bender, and thus largely excuses itself in retrospect---into the great theories of existence, he almost invariably acts and makes decisions with surgical, instinctive precision.\nIndeed, much of Donaghue's internal monologues are presented with tongue in cheek at his natural chatterati leanings, while the book itself only ever wakes up in the presence of his Sartrean actions. With this shift of emphasis, Under the Net demonstrates the importance of moral constancy, during such emotional crises as might have unseated our rational appreciation of what it is to be good. That it manages to achieve such a high-minded goal while being a bright, robust, powerful read shows that a pill of any bitterness can in principle be sweetened, depending on the talents of the one who dispenses it.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Under the Net        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Iris Murdoch        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2002)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/man-thinketh-his-heart.html"},{"title":"Mann is an island","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Little Herr Friedemann        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Thomas Mann        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1976)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nDoes she love me? Could she love me? Am I fool to think that I might ever have had the chance...? Uncertainty plagues the lead characters in Mann's short stories, condemned as they are by their physical deformities (Little Herr Friedemann) or by their undesirability among the very people they court (The Blood of the Walsungs). It dogs them and promotes them, turning their inner lives into a roller-coaster of emotions of which the outside world rarely, if ever, has any knowledge.\nAs is clear from this collection, the world of Thomas Mann is cold and lonely. Relationships between individuals are really distant orbits around each other in otherwise empty space. Where contact is apparently made, it turns out to be unreciprocated, twisted, or otherwise missing the mark (Tobias Mindernickel or The Blood of the Walsungs). Large crowds, on the other hand, offer a safe if banal alternative to painful solitude or the hopelessness of trying to interact with one other human being (The Dilettante and The Infant Prodigy). Crowds have their own lack of meaning, or perhaps lost meaning, but characters can sit in a crowd either with no delusions or utterly delusional; this is at least preferable to the constant neurotic questioning of the couple.\nSuch tensions and misery can leave Mann's work relentless, were it not for his sympathetic portrayal of the apparently extreme individuals who occupy the borders of society. This people over-analyse their condition obsessively, and pick apart minutiae before tweezering through the remains. But it's this that drives the individuals, and that makes us understand them and even empathise with them. Anyone can recognize the outrage of the main character in The Way to the Churchyard or Gladius Dei: recognize it, pity it, and feel it in their bones. A Weary Hour is the portrait of the artist as a nail-biting lunatic, but we could all be that crazy composer, and many of us would consider the trade worthwhile.

The starkness of many of their novelized lives is belied by some divinity shaping their ends, or at least affording them a degree of salvation or condemnation. In this way Greeneland is similar in structure to the rigid, pitiless universe of Dante's Divine Comedy. Once we accept that Greene's early conversion to Roman Catholicism has informed these moral sensibilities---in ways that your average born-again would scarcely conscience---it follows that we will ask: what else in his life found its way into his work?\nGreene's autobiography ought to provide the ideal environment in which  to interrogate him. There's refreshingly little evidence that A  Sort of Life constitutes a land-grab by Greene, an attempt to stake  out territory that biographers might otherwise camp on to reveal the  nastier features thereof. The tone is gentle and neutral: he claims in the  preface to have written the book in good faith, both to his readers and to  his younger self, and this faith shines from the book far more than the  religious sort. While one can always argue for subconscious layers of  misdirection, there is a warts-and-all honesty evident in these ramblings  about his early life.\nDull yet interesting, is probably the neatest summary of his first twenty-odd years presented here. His cloistered, upper-middle-class upbringing is claustrophobic and privileged; he is surrounded by the extended Greene family and attends the school his father owned and headmastered. Unintentionally funny childhood games and a marked precocity on the part of young Graham strengthen the usual stereotypes of his class; there's also implied, passive but unceasing encouragement from his parents, effortlessly brought to bear on their child. Greene's formative years are clearly micromanaged to an extent, the size of which he barely acknowledges.\nTherein lies the major flaw in A Sort of Life. While  Greene is scrupulously honest about his mundane conversion, his fears of  destitution following early, devastating failure, and his own gradual  gendering---when he remembers, almost as an afterthought, to mention  it---he is simply rattling the details off with the minimum of analysis or  reflection. One is simultaneously encouraged by the glut of information  and irritated by the lack of preparation and consideration of it.\nIf this were fiction, Greene would have written it as a grey, ambiguous  story with hints of deep principles at work. As it is, this factual  splurge is better thought of as rough notes, that a professional  biographer would be able to take up as a promising starting point, not a  finished book. His time in juvenile therapy, the brief mentioning of  sexual frissons, his isolation and nervousness, the discovery of faith  through his wish to marry... all of these stories have depth, and beg  questions as much as they provide answers, but here the questions are not  even considered. There exists the possibility of a discussion of Graham  Greene's sort of life that illuminates both the man and his work, but  Greene himself was never the man to write it.\n  \n    \n            \n                    A Sort of Life        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/matters-maketh-man.html"},{"title":"Meaningless meaninglessness","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Antic Hay        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Aldous Huxley        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThere's no end to the fun one could poke at the Bloomsbury Group.   Self-acknowledged legislators of their little literary world, their sense of their own worth led them to greater and greater excesses of pomposity; even as they wrote the occasional tract that might have supported their beliefs, were these essays not so easily buried under their public personas. The more recent concepts of celebrity were alive and well in the first third of the last century, and Bloomsbury exemplified them.\nSatirist and novelist Aldous Huxley was, if not a close member of this  set, then a well-liked one: close friend of Lawrence and indulging in a  ménage à trois with his wife and Mary Hutchinson.  It's therefore odd to find his stance in Antic Hay that of  on the inside, pissing in.\nWritten in 1923 and set around that time, this novel charts the lives  of a handful of the bright young things flung from the dizzy  merry-go-round of Great War moralizing into amoral, immoral or supermoral  lifestyles. Predominating in the numerous personal strands that make up  this tangled book is the narrative of Gumbril, inventor, everyman, made  independent by his pneumatic innovation---inflatable pants---and quitting  the drudgery of pedagogy in favour of the social whirl exemplified by Mrs  Viveash, Mr Mercaptan and others.\nFrom ridiculous trousers Huxley moves to the more and more ridiculous, culminating in a whirlwind farewell journey made by Gumbril. His one chance of emotional depth has been sacrificed for a triviality, and it is to a triviality he is about to depart: he and Viveash thus make one last pointless tour of his empty-souled companions. The strength of the satire, in this procession of emblems of uselessness, is palpable but like Gumbril it goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing. If the joke of this novel is in ironic vacuity, then once the instinctive and immediate comprehension of the period is lost, then so is the irony:  what then is left?\nIt's true: there's no end to the fun one could poke at the Bloomsbury Group. But then; not now. Now they're all simply dead, and dust, and the joke at the heart of this novel is already tight as parchment skin and dry as bones. Without the life of the carnival running through it, Antic Hay is a grinning, empty skull, laughing at a joke that maybe no modern reader can really get.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Antic Hay        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Aldous Huxley        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/meaningless-meaninglessness.html"},{"title":"In the midst of death, we are in life","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Norwegian Wood        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Haruki Murakami        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThree friends, Toru, Naoko and Kizuki, have all reached seventeen years of age; Kizuki will never grow older. He commits suicide, inexplicably, after a companionable evening playing pool with Toru. Naoko, Kizuki's girlfriend, appears normal but harbours an inconsolable inertia, dragging her towards death and Kizuki. Toru and Naoko find themselves drawn together as survivors of the tragedy, but after consummating their relationship they head off to different universities in 1960s Japan.\nNaoko soon finds herself in a summer-of-love sanatorium, a half-way house between reality and mental institutions, that eventually proves to be an insufficient substitute for either of those environments. Meanwhile, Toru finds himself on the voyage of largely undisturbed studenthood: coasting past the rocky cliffs of unsuccessful student revolutions; idling on the tantalising, sunkissed beaches of his friend Nagasawa's hedonistic sex-filled lifestyle; always returning to the safe, regimented harbours of his vaguely sinister dormitory life; and eventually pursuing the treasures of fellow traveller Midori. She, a confusing, confused, lively fellow student, quickens troubled waters much as Naoko seems to calm them down. Toru finds himself pulled between the two conflicting goals of Midori and Naoko, two possible waystations in his young life: but which can really lead him to his final destination, his true self?\nIn capturing the spirit of the decade, Norwegian Wood finds an authentic voice which nonetheless acts to distance itself from the modern-day reader. While its original release in 1987 might have swept up thirty- to fifty-somethings who could have related almost immediately to its weird atmosphere of free love, spirituality and politics, its English translation in 2003 seems a little too far away to leave so much of its assumptions unexplained. The sheer amount of sex that Toru indulges in, with friends and the friends of his girlfriends, frequently reaches Carry-On proportions. Naoko's sanatorium is frankly ridiculous in its lack of rules, its self-declared equalization of doctor and patient, the openness of house it operates. It's the sort of social experiment that, were it to actually have existed, would be famous or infamous, depending on its ultimate fate.\nBut while these details do occasionally jar---sometimes quite strongly---the central story is nonetheless strong and supple. When Toru is quiet and contemplative, and his contemplations are not specifically detailed in his narration or in somewhat formalized correspondence, then his unspoken inner self commands profound sympathy from the reader. Toru's suppressed pain, his consternation, and his lack of awareness of the loss and lack of direction he is suffering from, waft intoxicatingly off the pages like the smell of patchouli; or, more appropriately, myrrh.\nThe novel ironically really comes alive as Toru sits at the bedside of Midori's dying father: Toru's own unashamed capacity for action leads him to eat and chat in front of the taciturn, fasting old man. The invalid is in turn encouraged to eat, and begins to talk in the urgent, cryptic monosyllables that are all his recent brain surgery will permit. From here Toru's life with Midori gathers a speed that contrasts with Naoko's (which is gradually slowing to a crawl) and Kizuki's (long since stalled in his fume-filled car). Indeed, Toru is surrounded on all sides by suicides, fatalities and mysterious, permanent disappearances, yet he himself is always flung forward under these pressures like soap squeezed in the hands, cutting across in defiance of the narrative currents that threaten to pull him back to those dangerous seventeen years of age, where Kizuki continues to wait for all this novel's players, arms extended in a terrible, bleak welcome.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Norwegian Wood        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Haruki Murakami        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/midst-death-we-are-life.html"},{"title":"A misanthropic sort of occupation","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Nostromo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Joseph Conrad        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £1.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Wordsworth        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe province of Sulaco, convulsed by the revolution which has engulfed the Latin-American state of Costaguana, desperately needs honourable men. Captain Mitchell would gladly inform anyone who might ask him that Giovanni Battista Fidanza, the Capataz de los Cargadores, the great Nostromo, was the most trustworthy fellow along the entire coast. But Nostromo's honour is a constructed thing, a fame built purposefully by the Capataz with the premise that one might as well be famous for being honourable than for being duplicitous. When he is asked to save the silver of San Tomé mine from the armies, so that Sulaco might gain independence, the brave deed fits so well into the story of his life that he cannot refuse. But as he finds himself alone in the Golfo Placido, and finally the last person alive to know that the silver has not been lost, his resolve, and the faith he has in his capitalist-idealist masters, begins to quaver.\nThe rest of Sulaco can only ever guess at the genuine beliefs and passions of such an actor as Nostromo, a man who has become the devil-may-care cavalier of his own myths. But as silver and expectations weighs heavy on the backs of Nostromo and Martin Decoud (the architect of future independence), we begin to see beneath the façade. A complex Gian' Battista had once determined to create the simple, boisterous Capataz, and when his faith in his place in the schemes of his so-called countrymen is shaken then the original, less dependable Fidanza emerges, confused and thinking furiously. Conrad takes an archetype and forces him to shrug off the armour of his cynicism, leaving a more vulnerable, sympathetic character behind. Almost all of the characters in Nostromo provide an enjoyable read, but it is to the tragedy of the Capataz that the reader's heart goes out.\nNostromo is a huge story in a reasonable-sized book. It encompasses capitalism, revolutionary politics, vast tracts of geography, the complexity of a tempted, imperfect man, and the birth of a new nation. It reads almost like a serial, certainly like an epic. Conrad has used a number of techniques to spread his work far beyond the vision of his book, reaching out into misty indistinction both at the beginning of the story and at the start of the denouement. Here the story looks far into first the past and then the future, so that it draws all of history and predestiny into its scope. And as one approaches the fovea centralis, the narrow, frightening pit of the silver's concealment and of Nostromo's darkening soul, the story slows, repeats and concentrates. The scenes in the Golfo Placido, when Decoud can see nothing but Nostromo's near-black corneas, become indelible phosphorescences, long after the book has ended.\nThe sheer substance of Nostromo can make it hard to digest at times, and the book is certainly no easy page-turner. Yet its density is also instructive, and scarcely as heavy as the load that the poor Capataz must carry on his back: of hopes, responsibility and guilt. The story of a man in torment is no easy read, but it becomes an inevitable one, drawing the reader back to the sometimes difficult work over and over again.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Nostromo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Joseph Conrad        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £1.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Wordsworth        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/misanthropic-sort-occupation.html"},{"title":"My vibrations will live on","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Vertigo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Bloomsbury        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWhen you die, does your soul pass into another's? Flavières would once have said no. Once a straightforward-thinking policeman, a terrible accident during a rooftop pursuit of a suspect made him forsake the service for the life of a private investigator. But when he falls in love with his best friend's wife Madeleine, who he's trying to protect from herself, and who seems to be channeling the spirit of a suicidal ancestor Pauline, what should he believe? And when Madeleine finally succeeds in killing herself, only for Flavières to find Renée who resembles her to an uncanny degree, what can he think then? Is Pauline truly Madeleine, and Madeleine truly Renée, though the grave separates them all?\nNot a word is wasted in this taut, chilling thriller that inspired the Hitchcock film. Initially released in the French as D'Entre les Morts and translated as The Living and the Dead, the book is now typically found under the title of its cinematic equivalent. Flavières moves swiftly and unstoppably, more a plummet than a controlled journey, through the weighty scenes of the case, and the disintegration of his rational mind is frightening to behold. Different locations have their leitmotive in the text, with the fatefulness of the village church contrasting with the warm sleepiness of post-war Marseilles. Every new chapter is a surprise, with twists and turns that are as easy to follow as they are hard to predict.\nAn updated translation might be welcome: speech is occasionally stilted, even for the 1940s, and it might be said that there's a French frankness of discussion that seems out of place in the English.

But Urgent Copy is worth reading, and arguably worth writing about. Burgess wrote for many reasons. He wrote for fun; he wrote for profit. He wrote to settle scores, and he wrote with the urgency of a man condemned by doctors to die. Most importantly and proverbially, though, he wrote and wrote and wrote. It must have been easy to skim off the cream and package it as this volume.\nBurgess proceeds from his fields of expertise and deep interest (Nabokov, Beckett) through standard literary-rag fare (Shakespeare, Milton) arriving quite happily and breezily in landscapes he himself is clearly only just discovering (the brothers Grimm and Walter Bagehot---there: a review of a review of reviews). Not to worry, though: like Bertrand Russell, Burgess will happily cover acres of ground that we could never cover for ourselves; as with Russell, we must inevitably discover the hidden snares for ourselves.\nWhat stands out are his reviews of stinkers. As he says in his preface, he is always willing to give his fellow trench-diggers the benefit of the doubt. So when Williams' Modern Tragedy \"makes tragedy a very tragic business\", the understatement (which elsewhere seems a little overindulgent) is as damning as a personal slur. But above all Burgess' writing shines with a rhetorical and intellectual clarity, that some mistake for a pretence to rigid, studious integrity. Despite the huge body of work he has left behind in the field of criticism and analysis---only a slice of it exhumed in Urgent Copy---he was above all a complicated mix of author and journalist. At his worst, he is eminently readable. At his best, he's a joy.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Urgent Copy        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1973)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/non-stop-press.html"},{"title":"Nothing worth having ever trickles down","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Vineland        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Thomas Pynchon        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1992)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nIn his classic of the genre, The Crying of Lot 49, Thomas  Pynchon provided us with the perfect postmodern novel: to be committed to  postmodernity is to constantly attempt to pull one's narrative up by the  roots, demolishing established certainties. In this climate of endless  renewal, the heroine of Lot 49 finds herself utterly adrift  from notions of an independently viable history of facts, as her life  skips from onepossible explanation to the next.\nThe postmodern pragmatist might claim that the roots of a story need not always be hacked at until one comes free (inevitably in anticipation of the next binding). Instead, any prop that doesn't yield to the first half-dozen blows can be counted on to be as much a support as an encumbrance. In this spirit, Pynchon's Vineland attempts to apply postmodern techniques to a story anchored to an inescapably real timeline. Pynchon takes us on a whirlwind tour of Reagan's United States, flitting from washed-up sixties throwback Zoyd Wheeler, through his free-spirit daughter Prairie and her goth-rock boyfriend Isaiah-Two-Four, out into Mafia parties, Weather-Underground assassins, two Phlegyas-like car-repair men and a mountainside retreat of fighting nuns, to the hidden players of Zoyd's ex-wife and her one-time lover and CIA fixer Brock Vond. In the background are the usual Lynchian flights of fantasy, irrelevant (and sometimes needlessly irreverent) plays on words, and complexities only half-hinted at in an attempt to destabilize the reader.\nThe demolition of one point of view after another is employed here to  heighten the disillusionment that many---Pynchon probably included---felt  in 1980s America, with its brash ignorance and the triumph of \"surface\"  that it heralded. But, in the light of Lot 49, this use of  the narrative trick feels more like an abuse, cheapening the many-voice  premise by making it work instead towards unravelling a series of gotchas  and personally received wisdoms. It doesn't help that Pynchon's voice is  wildly uneven, as if he's not certain whether he's trying to skit Don  Delillo, John le Carré, Jonathan Franzen, Franz Kafka, Gabriel  Garcia Marquez, Alice Walker or Gore Vidal; he spends a few pages in the  voice of one before either getting bored or letting his mind wander, at  which point he takes up another's. This might be intended, once again, to  demolish the preconceptions of... you get the picture, but ultimately it  smacks of poor editing: a misjudged prank played on the reader, whose  patience wears thinner as the story progresses.\nIt's a shame because there's so much to like in Vineland. Pynchon has a deep, intuitive understanding of the flowering of the media age. In his portrayal of TV as \"the tube\", with semimythical \"Tubal\" victims and the mythical-yet-real, walking-dead Thanatoids, and in the revelation of characters' understandings as strata of photographs, experiences, memories, more photographs, music and the moving picture, he deconstructs the self and its dependencies on the culture that surrounds it. This climate of instability especially favours Prairie Wheeler, as she stands admirably in for her mother's ever-absent, supposed complexity. But when the limits of the reader's patience is tried by one character setting up yet another clunking, pointless pun of which they themselves are unaware---about the occurrence of the mathematically \"natural number\" 2.71828... sounding \"natural\" to them---it's clear that the real irony is that, if Vineland read naturally, developed naturally and had a natural, classical story arc, it would actually have been a better book.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Vineland        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Thomas Pynchon        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1992)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/nothing-worth-having-ever-trickles-down.html"},{"title":"Often chased, frequently bought","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    A Gun for Sale        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe shadowy heads of the military-industrial complex stage a murder to provoke war but, unable to resist the irony (and hoping it will solve the problem) they pay the hired killer in counterfeit notes.

When his path crosses that of a well-meaning chorus girl, Raven sees a way out of his situation and into the offices of the powerful. But whose side is she on? If she's really Raven's friend, then who else's is she too?\nIn the hands of Jack Higgins or another equally pedestrian potboiler-monger, A Gun For Sale would quickly descend into the morass of clichés that constitute every similar spy thriller. Worse, Higgins' tendency would be to dramatize the evil inherent in so many characters in this novel. But Greene has a light touch, and though the story is itself rather slight it can nonetheless float free of the weights that others might place on it.\nAlways searching for a point in Greene's writing---even a volume this slim must have more content than meets the eye---one can quickly find his usual ethical nudging, gentler here than in his later magna opera out of necessity of form as much as anything else.  It's astonishing that, even in what seems at first glance to be hack work, Greene can still embed such a strongly, quietly Catholic message. Evil is dirty and miserable, and violence has no glamour in Greeneland, where everything exists in shades of dismal grey---except the fundamentals of morality, which are starkly black and white---and where losing faith can lead to damnation as quickly as putting a bullet in a man.\n  \n    \n            \n                    A Gun for Sale        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/often-chased-frequently-bought.html"},{"title":"One man's account","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    B.

Payment is due, he feels: from his seminal encounter with an in-the-way Edwardian office block (debit one scratch on the brickwork), through his employers and co-workers (debit five tons of carbon-copy paper, delivered in apparent error) to the Houses of Parliament themselves (debit tbc.), Malry calculates in a common coinage the wrongs done to him, and acts accordingly to recover those debts. But his accounting is suffering overinflation, people are dying, and the clockwork train of Malry's morality is careering out of control....\nIt's rare to come across a novel which simultaneously conveys such tension and obsession with detail, while pouring forth exuberance and sheer joy in the craft of writing well. B. S. Johnson's Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry is such a book. The plot kapows from one ecstatic event to another, supported ably by Johnson's literary caprices that Joyce and Borges would sell their aunts for. He stretches the form just far enough to generate plenty of heat, but not so far that it snaps under the strain. This is the bleeding edge of novel construction, and Malry skims along this blade like an angel dancing on a pinhead, living through his dangerous, violent, hilarious exploits like no thriller hero has ever done.\nJohnson is---was, God keep him---a stunning writer. Christie Malry leaps off the page, while still being aware on one level of Johnson pulling the strings.  Self-referential asides deftly sidestep the territory of the cynical, knowing wink and become respectful acknowledgements of the intelligence of the reader. The characters are all ripe, richly sympathetic and completely, completely believable. The story is genius and the narrative flawless magic.

What's the horrible secret the executioner keeps strictly in the family, and how might a Dostoyevskian murder be reinterpreted in a crumbling society, where a small tribe of squatters are bound by love and sex instead of the social contract? Ritual and impulse are stirred together in Fireworks, a collection of short stories from Angela Carter that presage The Bloody Chamber,  which in turn eventually brought her widespread critical acclaim.\nCarter always denied that she was putting the edge back into fairytales per se: rather, her intent was to strip it down to its violent, often sexual roots, to the point where it no longer resembled a story at all. The bare skeleton would then be fleshed out until a new story presented itself. Yet the ones in Fireworks still resemble their ancestors, and the strongest---Penetrating to the Heart of the Forest, and The Loves of Lady Purple---are also probably the closest to the \"originals,\" whilst Flesh and the Mirror and A Souvenir of Japan meander in comparison, at the same time showing little glimpses of the underlying fairytale.\nThis is not intended to disparage Carter's authorship; arguably her own voice is the quintessence which brings the stories to life. But there's a subtler cautionary tale here for every prospective homo fabulans, hoping to fashion something new in the telling of a story: the pelts of the monsters, that once frightened our ancestors in their caves, can never truly be swept from the bones; and there are deep, dark reasons why things that we might nowadays call terrific or awful can nonetheless sometimes still have teeth.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Fireworks        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Angela Carter        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Virago        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/or-feyne-thyng-or-fynde-wordes-newe.html"},{"title":"Out of the mouths of babes and veterans","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Wise Children        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Angela Carter        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1992)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWhat's it like to be a twin? Someone I work with is sick of being asked that question (and yes, he's a twin), and invariably delivers the riposte: \"what's it like not being a twin?\" Philosophically adroit, but more reasonable twins, after a lifetime of mistaken identity, might venture something stoic like \"ah, well, you make do.\" Perhaps in stereo.\nCarter is on rich, earthy form with Wise Children, her own Much Ado About Nothing that flashes back from the tarnished, nostalgic present of the Chance sisters---twins Dora and Nora, a rhyming couple---through their careers and relationships. The tangles of their lives are teased out for all to see, dragging the reader willingly, indeed gladly, across continents and from one slightly harebrained theatrical production to the next.\nThe sisters not only make do, but they have a rare time, doyennes of the stage and film living it up from one end of the century to the next. They make the very best of their bastard's lot---the Chances are illegitimate offspring of Melchior Hazard, and the wordplay doesn't stop there. Famous dancer Estella and beefy Cassius sit on the list of dramatis personæ alongside the worthy Worthingtons, a film producer referred to only as \"Genghis Khan\", a writer and photographer of children referred to only as \"Lewis Carroll\", the Blond Tenor With Unmemorable Name and no fewer than four sets of twins, celebrating the identical melodramas of Shakespeare and vaudeville (off-stage if not on) with a whirlwind, joyful carnival of confusions and happenings.\nOstensibly a bawdy, comic tale, the novel's depth reveals itself, slowly and quietly, in its depiction of men---particularly the Hazards---with all their loves, desires, accomplishments and spectacular folly, as seen through the eyes of women---particularly the Chances. From this inversion of the usual device of the male gaze Carter pours forth candidness and comprehension, but reins in judgmentalism, to generate affection for all her characters, in a warts-and-all depiction that leaves one crying out for more. More assignations! More parties! More days for Dora and Nora, days for them to dance and sing!\n  \n    \n            \n                    Wise Children        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Angela Carter        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1992)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/out-mouths-babes-and-veterans.html"},{"title":"People who don't need people","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    1982 Janine        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alasdair Gray        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nFor a man so utterly alone, Jock MacLeish is hardly lonely. So he's eschewed all meaningful relationships. So he's now haunted by his own insomniac self, in a hotel room in Peebles (or is it Selkirk: what day is it?). But he still keeps himself company, with the women who populate his relentlessly pornographic, if sometimes barely sexual, fantasies. In one night, with one bottle of scotch, one of pills, and a surprise appearance from God, Jock will take his imaginary women and his own dark self to pieces. He'll examine each piece in turn, and cast everything he hates into the fire that's brewing in his single malt. It's not clear if there'll be anything left by morning.\nAlasdair Gray writes richly and deeply, reveals rarely and tantalisingly, and is utterly unafraid of experimenting with typography, dialect, narrative... any aspect of the novel is fair game. He captures the grim selfishness of Thatcherite Britain and the sexual power politics of a middle-aged misogynistic misanthrope perfectly. Jock is an intellectual and idealist, but when he capitulates he makes his fortune. Of course, he loses everything in the process---Denny, Alan, Helen, his parents, his self-respect (although he'd deny it if you asked)---but he compensates by steeping his soul in the powerful opium of his girls:   Janine, Superb and all the others who relentlessly parade, undress, are kidnapped, resist, parade, undress.\nBut those girls: they're not just a defect in Jock, they're the problem with this novel. A large chunk of it is ostensibly made of these short stories which, intentionally, aren't believable and never reach a climax (although, true to Gray's typical warts-and-all methodology, Jock reaches one or two). These fantasies are part scalpels that dissect Jock, part phantasms of his boozed state that force the reader to share in his confusion; but they're so annoying and invasive, an interruption rather than a revelation. Only in these does Gray ever hammer a point home too hard: hate Jock, Gray tells us; hate him and pity him. But we don't need any more convincing. Gray's prose in itself carries conviction, and he needn't try as hard as he does in 1982 Janine.\n  \n    \n            \n                    1982 Janine        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alasdair Gray        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/people-who-dont-need-people.html"},{"title":"A photograph is a secret about a secret","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Master Georgie        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Beryl Bainbridge        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nBeautiful George Hardy has never been alone. With some utterly  undefineable charisma he is able to attract and then surround himself with  a coterie of friends, quasi-servants and general hangers-on. The cerebral  Dr Potter hovers around him, gradually exhausting Georgie's good will and  his purse. Meanhwile, poor Myrtle is so devoted to him that she has become  an it that loves, while Pompey Jones, with his birth-bruised upper lip and  a dark heart, knows he is closer to what Georgie really wants. Between  them these three tell their stories, inextricably entwined with Georgie's  own, and punctuated by the drawn-out procedures that the taking of  photographs demanded in the 19th century. Georgie is a force of nature,  pulling them all along in his wake. But he couldn't stop his father dying;  he can't deflect his own desires; and ultimately nothing will help him  dodge whatever Crimean bullet bears his name.\nAt first glance this is a light book. Sparsely told, Myrtle's first  story (of six: two told by each companion) seems far lighter and simpler  than the events that it portrays. But it soon becomes clear that Beryl  Bainbridge spares not a single one of her  sentences in this novel: each  is necessary, a grain of oxidized silver that permits us eventually to see  the full picture of these tragic, twisted lives. The more stories we read,  the more the truth of the characters' history is filled in, and we are  given not merely the appearance of past events but also their sinister  import. We gradually learn the truth about Potter's dysfunctional  marriage, Georgie's friendship with Pompey, and the provenance of  Georgie's children. Always there is something more, some other dimension  to the events already described, that change their aspect completely and  leave the reader guessing: is this really the truth? Is the truth yet to  come?\nIndeed, despite the apparent simplicity, this book can perform arcane  and legion magic tricks on the mind of the reader. Each chapter begins  with a description of a photograph to be taken at some point before it  ends, ironically summarizing some subtler aspect of the story. And the  first time it switches voices between characters is a sublime event, so  apparently effortless is the manoeuvre. The gradual dissolution of one  narrator's senses in the heat of war is terrifying in its sense of  rationality falling unstoppably downhill. And as the dirty secrets of each  character start to tumble out one by one, littering their understandings  of each other, so too does the dirt and blood of war multiply and spread,  filth piling upon filth, with our four characters scrabbling over the dead  and dying to keep their heads above its level, still climbing, still  devoted to Master Georgie, right up to the book's cold, cold climax.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Master Georgie        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Beryl Bainbridge        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Abacus        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/photograph-secret-about-secret.html"},{"title":"Piano forte","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Quiet American        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nFowler is a correspondent in Saigon, occasionally making trips into the heart of the Indo-Chinese war. But insofar a coherent country called Greeneland might ever be said to exist, he's in it. Whether in the city or in the middle of other people's fighting, he finds himself on the fault line between the personal and political, as Pyle, arousing suspicions as a visiting American without clear portfolio, arouses passions too in Fowler's Vietnamese mistress Phuong. As Fowler grapples, lonely and godless, with a conscience that cannot tell one wrong from another, innocent people start to die as terrorists plant makeshift bombs throughout the city: Fowler knows who may really have caused their deaths.\nGreene is able to squeeze moral good from his villains by a subtle twisting of typical Manicheanisms. Here he flips over the (once topical) dichotomy set up by the self-proclaimed heroes, America. Communism, for all its faults, shares those faults with so-called democracies; meanwhile its almost theological observances sneak in a note of ascetic virtue. Both ideologies prop up evil acts, as Greene shows, but at least Communism means it. It's an interesting take on the politics, the product of a hyperrealism that can only be bred out of war and the logical extreme of cultural tourism: you feel he'd never get away with The Quiet Vietnamese.\nMore personally, even if he were to win back Phuong, Fowler would have to make his decisions alone, without consultation or prayer. This is life without spiritual community, life for the atheist who, unlike his estranged and undivorceable wife, cannot confess, cannot confide. He must instead deaden his existential pain with a poppy-pipe and the love of Phuong, more a muffling, resolute tolerance than affection.\nIn the course of the novel Greene drags Fowler, as he has done to so many of his other protagonists, through intrusive social closeness and abject spiritual loneliness. The distance between Fowler and his actions, bridged by thin threads of reason and humanism, is sometimes too great to be plausible. The matter-of-factness of the climax, itself practically a denouement, leaves one dazed and full of unanswered, unanswerable questions. Nonetheless its tense thrillerisms pull The Quiet American back from the brink of a reflexive reductio ad absurdum. They wrap it up, disguise it, deliver it with little fuss into the hands of the reader, who receives it and takes it to his heart, a quiet book about a quiet man, each as innocuous and explosive as a home-made bomb.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Quiet American        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/piano-forte.html"},{"title":"The quill is mightier than the sword","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Porcupine        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Julian Barnes        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nEvery Julian Barnes book is different from the rest. Nonetheless, there is a particular method he returns to in order to drive the plot. He lets each character play out a rich, complex internal life in front of the reader to inform their often otherwise often inexplicable actions. It is this which lends a humanity to Barnes' least human---and, in some stories, non-human---protagonists. In The Porcupine, a short story about the trial of fictional, deposed, Soviet-satellite leader Stoyo Petkanov, he uses this method to achieve the impossible: to make liberals fall in love with a communist Alf Garnett.\nPetkanov is a totalitarian boor, a lost soul, a Kurtz that cannot be brought back from the darkness. Yet, as Martin Amis accomplishes in Time's Arrow, Barnes forces us to examine our own morality through its mad inverted twin, which permeates Petkanov's tirades against the running-dog upstarts who dare to question his rule. His world has fallen apart but he remains together---although not for long---and we feel the visceral heat of his coherent outrage. As Peter Solinsky, chief prosecutor under the new regime, tries to find a foothold for the intended public prosecution of the old dictator, the reader must face the imperfections of post-Soviet societies stripped of their capitalist rhetoric, and wince at the bitterness that Petkanov feels, when he remembers the chance he had had to rejuvenate and perhaps even save communism. Gorbachev, fucking Gorbachev, supposed hero of the cold war, broke his promise to Petkanov, Petkanov's country, all of the Soviet Union and communism itself. Well, didn't he, Petkanov demands?\nIf Arthur Koestler had had a more jesterly sense of humour, we would have had from him The Porcupine instead of Darkness at Noon. Koestler's moral ambiguity stems from Rubashov's own admission of his guilt, as part of a system immoral both as a whole and as its constituent individuals, and his later attempts to live, briefly, with himself; Barnes plays on the sympathy one feels, sitting outside this irredeemable old man. It's a sympathy born of pity---he's a pathetic figure, twisted in the absence of his moral compass---but the feeling itself stands as a testament to man's eventual humanity to man.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Porcupine        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Julian Barnes        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/quill-mightier-sword.html"},{"title":"The Red and the Bleak","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Comrade Don Camillo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Giovanni Guareschi        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1976)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, August 4, 2006, and on the ReadReverb website)\nThe atmosphere of the Cold War now seems as alien to us as that of prohibition America, or the grime and crime of Victorian London, and it's easy to forget what strange, misshapen battle-lines were drawn in those years. The Roman Catholic Church and the Communists found themselves on opposite sides of the putative Front for a number of reasons---the former's investment in established orders; the latter's tacit hostility to any religion proportional to the extent to which it might be \"organized\"---despite professing respective interests in the soul and freedom of the common man. But it's in this subtle, fearful era that we find Don Camillo, Italian priest, secreting himself and a copy of the Gospels into Russia as part of a junket arranged by international branches  of the Communist party.\nGuareschi's series of stories about Don Camillo all have a knockabout atmosphere to them: Father Brown, retold as farce. The priest causes havoc on the trip, using Communist pedantry to split the little group of Italian Reds, starting fights and revealing (to themselves, not to the authorities) the deeply-buried religion of both oppressed natives and disillusioned politico-tourists. And, as usual, Camillo has a rather everyday hotline to God and Jesus in his head, and this familiarity extends to parish-magazine cartoons at the start of each chapter, parables of the ensuing stories. But of all the books in the series, this alone has a core of iron to it: sometimes the silliness drifts away like smoke to reveal a rather withering satire of aspects of Communist Russia that we now all know to have been true. One wonders why, of all the books, it's the last one that has condensed so surprisingly in this way.\nOnly on reaching Guareschi's postscript is this change of tone explained. In keeping with the times in which he wrote, the author considered himself under siege---politically, culturally and journalistically---from the Communists, and seems to have moved a pace or two in the direction of the hard right-wing, as a reaction to his own perceived oppression. It's as though the series has lost its admixture of Graham Greene's Monsignor Quixote that, thus far, has prevented it becoming a political tract. And although the stories are as fun and as intricate in their comedy as any of the earlier ones, spotting this swerve to the right serves as a timely reminder that, however clearly Don Camillo the man serves his God---and despite the moralizing against Communism, the priest remains a decent, kind, sympathetic figure---it's important to remember that the Don Camillo books are in  the service of their author, at the very least.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Comrade Don Camillo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Giovanni Guareschi        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1976)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/red-and-bleak.html"},{"title":"The rest in pieces","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Life a User's Manual        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    George Perec        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nAll human life is a collection of definite locations, and the lists of possibles that surround each definite. There is the country, town, street and house in which you were born, with rows and rows of roads either side, specks of other cities dotted around it, and other nations clinging to the borders that circumscribe your own. There are the contents of your room, your scrapbooks, your letters and your own head, each a localized summary of you, staggering its cluttered way through life. Thus the whole of humanity might be found in the history, contents, layout and occupants of, for example, an apartment block at 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier. The overlapping lists and structures might somehow reveal some greater story than the sum at each overlap, a thread that binds the whole together.\nSuch is the premise of this, Perec's magnum opus, where the interlocking lives and corridors of a nine-story apartment block provide a matrix from which to generate the whole world. There's no real plot arc---or it might be better to say that there are many, as each of the largest apartments in the block warrant multiple entries spread over the book---but stories are told and exchanged, and interlock, and reference each other and complement each other as the book develops. The contents of the cellars and the state of each item of junk's disrepair are told as lovingly and carefully as the coupling \"currently\" taking place between two tenants, or the murder of another's daughter and son-in-law.\nIt's difficult not to be astonished by the work Perec has put into this book. It has an index and chronology, the former including Triptolemy (Greek grammarian, seventh century), Franco Bahamonde (Spanish dictator, 1892--1976) and the National Union of Foresters and Woodcutters (Australia). All the stories are seamless and microscopically detailed in themselves, and the strands of the central plot---bored millionaire Bartlebooth decides to make a work of conceptual art out of his life by painting 500 watercolours, have a carpenter make them into jigsaws, reassemble the jigsaws and have them turned by a tame chemist back into blank, memoryless sheets of vellum: but his jigsaw-maker confounds him, and he begins to lose his sight, and time is running out---assemble so slowly and heartbreakingly that it's like watching your own father grow old before you. Life, Perec is telling us, is like a jigsaw, a complex puzzle, where each piece must sit in its rightful place like apartments in an apartment block, that only the fortunate can assemble and understand in the few short years we're given.\nBut Life, like life, is incredibly difficult to follow or indeed appreciate on the grand scale, and doesn't really work as a whole novel. This is a collection of short stories, themed and interrelated, and should ideally be read as such. It was all written twenty years too early for the technological platforms that would have done it genuine justice as the perfect, flawless hypertextual work of art that so clearly strains here against the boundaries of the pages of a simple, linear book. But even though we clearly need Perec now, it would be churlish not to be glad of what he wrote back then.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Life a User's Manual        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    George Perec        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/rest-pieces.html"},{"title":"Revenge of Etaoin Shrdlu","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Ella Minnow Pea        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Mark Dunn        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Methuen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2001)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nA book of letters, a novel without letters. What happens to human beings when their vocabulary is restricted, arbitrarily, one letter at a time? Such is the predicament of the inhabitants of Nollop, founded by the inventor of the Lazy Dog sentence, when letters begin falling off the great monument to Nevin Nollop. Books are confiscated and burned, to rid themselves of the Z that their founder has suddenly disdained from beyond the grave. And as the glue on the letters perishes further, so does their language and their freedoms. Those who speak words with the banned letters are flogged and eventually deported. Only the authorship of a pangram to rival Nollop's great sentence can save the island from an imposition of silence. Can Ella and her band of rebels put one together in time?\nMost fascinating in the novel is the subtle development of the language during the imposition of greater and greater strictures. Whether Dunn intended it or not, the tortures that language undergoes are chilling. The loss of Q, Z and J cause short words to be struck out and replaced by Latinate counterparts: long, flowery archaisms.  But eventually constituents of these longer words drop out of the sky, and out of common, legal use; some can be replaced, but a pidgin develops, a combination of grammatical tricks and permitted misspellings. An announcement of a death---“Mie  phrent Georgeanne perisht last night phrom let poisoning”---is turned from bathetic to pathetic, and this makes it all the more heartrending: such things are happening, and the words soon do not exist even to mourn, let alone protest. Society breaks down.\nAs a moral tale Ella Minnow Pea is thumpingly obvious in its message: state control over free speech leads to social decline and is the thin end of the wedge of totalitarianism. But as a lipogram it has a dynamism and fearfulness that the circumlocutions of A Void lack, and the central trick contributes to the tension and excitement rather than detracting from it. While the plethora of characters often makes it difficult to tell who is addressing whom, this study of the decline of such an epistolary society---Amos even leaves a note for his wife when she's in the bath---is a lesson well learnt, and a story well told.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Ella Minnow Pea        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Mark Dunn        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Methuen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2001)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/revenge-etaoin-shrdlu.html"},{"title":"The Ruffian in the Bed","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Orton Diaries        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Joe Orton        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nJoe Orton blazed a trail across the skies of the London thespian scene in the 1960s. His plays, specifically Entertaining Mr. Sloane, Loot, The Ruffian on the Stair and What the Butler Saw, were blistering, amoral commentaries on contemporary society, yet still have a vicious, gleeful sting to them. He was as overtly homosexual as one could be at the time, indulging in cottaging and trips abroad for sex. Margaret Ramsay, his agent, persuaded him to begin writing a memoir for posterity's sake; eight months later his long-suffering partner Kenneth Halliwell, having been prescribed drugs for depression, bludgeoned Joe to death and then committed suicide. The diaries, Halliwell wrote in his suicide note, would explain all.\nWhat we learn primarily from these diaries is that Joe Orton had more than his fair share of bumsex, and a lot of it in Tangier. There's more bumsex than you can shake a stick at, and Orton shakes his a great deal. Bumsex bumsex bumsex... you hopefully get the idea, but it's a shame that Orton's cock and arse eclipse such witty observational comedy. Every bus or train journey, Orton overhears and dutifully reports some ridiculous conversation snippet. He can be vicious about the middle class, and the lack of respect for literary peers and ancestors shown by both Orton and Halliwell landed them in jail for defacing library books.\nTo be fair, along with his tempestuous relationship with Halliwell (both emotional and professional, as Halliwell suggests changes and new ideas) the diaries reveal almost in passing so much about Orton. Reading between the lines of dirty talk, it's clear that he was so angry that he had passed through inarticulation.  He had honed a sharp, Swiftian knifeblade of comment that he then used to hack away at modern morality. He wrote quickly and keenly, revised just as quickly, and in the absence of the awful violence which did for him he'd probably still be writing now. I wonder what about.

Hence Charles rather than Charlie, and a threatening gilt-on-black cover, showing the white face of a sort of Chisely Higson peering at the prospective reader between the tines of a toasting fork.  Granted once you know the significance of the fork then a tremble is put in the bowels by the image, but by then you'd have made the minor error of reading the book.\nShould the cover not give it away, Happy Now is a thriller. It's based around the lives of a number of middle-class fuckups who interact messily and inappropriately. Tom Kendall is a borderline Asperger, adrift on a sea of suppressed rage and misery that he cannot understand, let alone verbalize; yet he tacks the course of a normal life until struck broadside by Will Summers. Will breaks into homes, with the goal of a sexual frisson rather than any malice. But when he is discovered during a dinner party at the house of Tom's brother-in-law bloody violence ensues. As Tom's sanity unravels, so do most of the aspects of the book.\nWhat this novel expertly captures is the core of self-hate that is meant to sit at the heart of middle England, a sort of Guardiangst or Daily Mourn that, if it doesn't really exist, is at least embodied in such vacuums as Milton Keynes or Slough. Early pictures of Tom are rich and detailed, but when we discover that his extreme reactions stem from a childhood of extremes---a lump of indigestible Freudianism thrust at you in case you're reading this undeniable page-turner too fast to notice it---then the book loses its edge. Tom is no longer normal enough to seem abnormal in this shadowy world of Manicheaen thrillerisms.  \nThis book just about predates The Fast Show. Plenty of the subsequent sketches are more subtly twisted and dangerous than the story here. It would be better for Higson if nobody mourned the passing of Happy Now into obscurity. You don't need to be a raving fan of the TV series (and its offshoots) to be willing to grant Higson the credentials of a gifted, populist writer, but after finishing Happy Now it's difficult to remember precisely why you thought he was so good in the first place.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Happy Now        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Charles Higson        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1994)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/scary-then.html"},{"title":"Seek and destroy","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Demolished Man        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alfred Bester        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Gollancz        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWe follow murderer Ben Reich and ESP-capable detective Lincoln Powell as they battle it out in twenty-fourth century America and in the timeless provinces of the human mind. Reich is an abnormality, a psychotic, who has hidden himself through tricks and bluffs from the sprawling organization of espers. The gifted have become, through Hippocratic principles, guardians of mankind's psychology. If Reich is a first-class killer then Powell is a first-class ESPer, and to trap Reich will take first-class methods. Everything hinges on the motivation, which only the espers can divine. Can they get to Reich in time?\nScience fiction arguably works better as a style rather than a genre---the pure desire to present fascinating ideas and scientific speculations is more suited to an encyclopædia than a novel, but by using those ideas as a medium and source of analogies for a story is a subtle balancing act that makes good, better, bester. That the The Demolished Man is a thriller, and a fast-paced, convoluted one at that, enjoyable and rich in detail and characters is undeniable; but that it's SF? Well... SF definitely takes a back-seat at times, but if it weren't along for the ride then where would the fun be?\nThe novel has aged badly in places. While Asimov can be forgiven for programming his spaceships with punched cards, making them charmingly Heath-Robinson, in fact, it's hard to forgive Bester for concretizing pre-1950s psychology. Ascientific Freudian nonsense mapped out before your eyes---a telepath having highly literate conversations with someone's preconscious, for example, or a trip through their ego, id and superego like the cheap special effects in Star Trek V---stumbles, and is stuffy and unconvincing. The more highfalutin reasons for risking so much to catch Reich are also, it must be said, nonsense: Reich killed someone, which nobody has done in mainstream society for years; why abstract it further when there's no need?\nBut if it is nonsense (and the careful characterizations, fascinating cultural/technological interfacing, and otherwise watertight plot must surely rescue the rest from such a condemnation), it's grand nonsense, blockbuster, rollicking, thumping, readable, enjoyable nonsense. If it's nonsense, then let's have more.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Demolished Man        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alfred Bester        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Gollancz        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/seek-and-destroy.html"},{"title":"A self-made man","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    James Joyce and the Making of Ulysses        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Frank Budgen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Oxford Paperbacks        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1989)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nTo write memoirs depicting one of the great artists of one's generation is to throw one's own talents into sharp relief. James Boswell has arguably suffered far more than his decent skill would suggest at the hands of critics for writing in the vast, pendulous shadow of Johnson. And to intersperse such recollections with details of your own life is to risk descending to a level of beam-in-your-eye Pooterism that generations to come will mock. So for Frank Budgen---middling painter, civil servant, self-made man---to attempt to describe James Joyce's time in Zürich (even as a first-hand account of the great man's conversations), and then to dot the novel with his own paintings, and to interpret chapters of both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake in painstaking detail, is to invite ridicule from every quarter.\nBudgen was clearly emboldened in his task by a cheerful ignorance of the hit-and-miss nature of his own gift for painting. An atmospheric portrait of Joyce on the flyleaf admirably captures the man's wiry, pent-up energy enthusiasm which often escapes later photographs, and his rendering of The Lotus Eaters is gentle and calm, while later plates include tortuously literal transcriptions of the symbology of Proteus and The Oxen of the Sun onto canvas, and what looks like Leopold Bloom wanking on the head of a bat in the vague direction of a distant Folies-Bergère filly. But all this is presented with the rather straightforward confidence that characterizes the rest of the book: Budgen doesn't comment on his own painting, and talks of himself only in the context of being in Joyce's wartime city, and to flesh out the city. In a sense his willing ignorance of himself makes him a factual everyman much like Bloom in fiction, and he becomes an excellent cipher for the tale of Joyce's wrestling with both books.\nIndeed, although Budgen does not make it explicit, it seems like Joyce was trying out a number of his literary and artistic theories on him:   whereas Joyce admits himself to be no critic---he can't let himself make such objective judgments in his own pursuit of his art qua subject---Budgen freely expresses his own taste, intentions and ideas all mixed together. Joyce and Budgen talk a good deal, none of it reflecting wonderfully on Budgen (and therefore probably true) but all of it enlightening about Joyce's opinions and motivations, both retrospectively behind Ulysses and also behind the ongoing Work in Progress that would become his last, great book.\nEvery few chapters Budgen unburdens himself of chapters of Joyce as if he has taken a purgative, and the effect is to prevent in turn the flow of the genial narrative that his more literal recollections comprise. No doubt he has a number of important points about the groundbreaking nature of Joyce's work to illuminate, but one does wish he might let the man speak for himself, given he clearly did so on many occasions. Still, he quickly picks up the thread again of his meetings with Joyce, and Zürich is described with understated, unaffected affection. The wartime antics of Budgen and the British in Switzerland are an amusing sideline to what, quietly and unassumingly, begins with an accurate picture of Joyce and eventually becomes a much more revealing, verbal portrait.\n  \n    \n            \n                    James Joyce and the Making of Ulysses        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Frank Budgen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Oxford Paperbacks        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1989)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/self-made-man.html"},{"title":"Shamus!

The case handed to him by the uppity lawyer representing anonymous Washington big-shots seems no different, although right from the start it's clear that someone is holding back. Who's the dame he's meant to follow from the train station? What's she running from? What has local spiv Larry Mitchell found out about her, and did he or didn't he appear, briefly, with a bullet in his heart on her balcony? What did Henry Clarendon IV see? What did the car-park attendant see? More importantly, what did his parrot see? And will he talk?\nChandler's plots are notoriously complicated. The Big Sleep never actually made sense, whoever the reader decided at the end the real killer was: there was always one death outstanding. In addition, Chandler's---well, Marlowe's---habit of rarely explicitly prejudging other people's actions means that you're left with what Marlowe narrates, and what others say or do, as the only indicators of what's really going on. This is either a hindrance to understanding character motive, or an indispensible element of Chandler's style, depending on your taste. Certainly, more than any other thriller writer, Chandler puts you right in Marlowe's skin, seeing what he sees, hearing what he hears, smelling what he can smell, occasionally thinking what he thinks, but no further than that.\nEventually the plot almost disentangles itself, or at any rate the central thread does. In any other writer---Agatha Christie, say---the sudden introduction of a new character to move the plot along might be criticised. But the centre is never the kernel of a Chandler story; rather, the reader is drawn to the little investigations and interactions that circle around it. Like Columbo, Marlowe entertains us in his journeys, not his destinations. Still, it's fitting that in this, Chandler's last novel, Marlowe finally arrives at the terminus he justly deserves, rather than the one he has always feared. Suddenly, it seems there is a God that shapes our ends; but Marlowe probably wouldn't like to comment, given such flimsy evidence, and Chandler...   maybe he knows by now, but dead men don't say nuthin.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Playback        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Raymond Chandler        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/shamus-where-thy-bluff.html"},{"title":"Shows promise, for a plongeur","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Down and Out in Paris and London        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    George Orwell        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\"Orwellian\" is an adjective much overused. On the basis of 1984 and Animal Farm, arguably his most famous works, Orwell's name has become adjectival for the machinations of sinister, privacy-stealing organizations, especially the state in its most nannying moments. Like \"Kafkaesque\", however, it's possible the word has been misapplied by the majority, acquainted only with the great works of the man.\nWhat should something be, then, if it is Orwellian? Concise, certainly. Journalistic, if that too is not a loaded qualifier, intimations of the middle- or lowbrow. Readable and companionable, like a long conversation with someone who always thinks right, even if they do not always conclude right. Not necessarily well written (whatever that means), but written with clarity and care.\nHints of all of these skills are evident in Orwell's first novel(la), Down and Out in Paris and London. Clearly the rock on which such better formed works as Keep the Aspidistra Flying were built, Down and Out... provides an account of Orwell's penury in the two great cities.  Reportage to its core, in writing it Orwell has ditched thesaurus and ornamental language to provide a flawed---count how many times something is described as \"queer\"---but engaging commentary.\nNot in itself a classic, then, but nonetheless unputdownable. Reading the whole book takes less than a few hours and leaves the reader with enormous insight into poverty, hunger, debasement: big topics dealt with by a tiny book, rich in grimy, dirty facts about the lifestyle that Orwell longed to understand, and knew in his middle-class heart that he never truly would. Perhaps, ultimately, this is the description of an Orwellian text: an economy of prose that nobody before or since has attained.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Down and Out in Paris and London        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    George Orwell        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £5.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/shows-promise-plongeur.html"},{"title":"Silt life","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Waterland        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Swift        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2002)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nTom Crick is in trouble. His wife has committed a miserable and foolish crime: precipitated by events long past; precipitating Crick's dismissal from his post as a history teacher. The school's headmaster has finally been given the excuse to downsize humanities in favour of the sciences, and Crick's backlash is the generation-spanning tapestry of Waterland. Where scientific principles might never have helped him, Crick develops his own view of progress and the advancement of time: civilization, and the existence of each civilized man, is nothing more than the excavation of accumulated silt, the continuous fight against nature to prevent dirt from blocking life, love and intelligent thought.\nSupporting this gloomy but inevitable conclusion are the multiple strands of Crick's family history, the history and development of the fenland where his and his wife's families have lived for generations, and even the course of English and world histories. Swift, narrating as Crick, develops themes on business big and small, transport and the folly of great schemes into a crescendo that focus history on the single act of Crick's wife, and the parallel events some twenty years ago involving Crick's educationally subnormal brother.\nA seamless mixture of human endeavour on both the large and small scale, Waterland is occasionally let down by the indeterminacy of one of its major conceits: to whom is Crick preaching his message? To the converted? The unconverted? The eternally apostate? To bring this in line with the ultimate recipients of the speech---children, dear children---Swift has had to execute appropriately quick turnarounds, and it is here that the story hiccups. But this is a minor fault, observed retrospectively, and for most of the novel the reader is drawn inexorably, like mud down the Ouse to the open sea, to a bleak, lonely and watery conclusion.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Waterland        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Swift        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2002)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/silt-life.html"},{"title":"Slow, slow, slow-slow slow","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    From the Diary of a Snail        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Günter Grass        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Minerva        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWhen Hermann Ott, nicknamed Doubt by his contemporaries, began teaching Jews and collecting snails during the prelude to the second World War, he probably didn't intend to become a champion for the underdogs. Doubt would never have made such a definite political statement, children; Doubt moves slowly, like his snails. He works hard, not with the ethic of the Protestant nor the gloom of the martyr to the economy, but with the manner of one shoring up sandbags against time. He sees the plaintive, whirling dervishes of here-and-now revolution, frowns and slows down: not just to watch, but to check his own speed.\nGrass aligned himself---probably still does---with Doubt in his partly fictional account of his own campaign trail during the 1969 election. The word \"trail\" develops many meanings as, in Grass' memoir, the snails that Doubt collects become the symbol of Social Democratic policy, and slowness the responsibility and duty of the intellectual in politics. Grass and Doubt follow their separate, dogged routes some thirty years apart, meeting on, say, a windswept beach so that Grass can air his grievances: not with the world, but with his own over-eagerness. Doubt is always there at Grass' right hand, holding him back with history's lesson, that to rush headlong is to eventually perish.\nIn this translated work, much of Grass' original project is evident. Narratives are rich and intertwine in a complicated montage that echoes Döblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz. Presumably it has been just as difficult to translate, as a lot of the effect is lost. Some of Grass' semi-spontaneous poetry is absolutely appalling in the English, ranging from mawkish to sesquipedalian with no redeeming qualities in between. The fact that Grass is on one level writing to answer the questions of his own sons and daughters is hammered home each and every time he calls the reader \"children\" (which is probably Grass' own error).   But his grasp of atmosphere and storytelling survives Grass' occasional patronising and Ralph Manheim's pedestrian translation. By detecting in advance whether the next section has odd line lengths it's easy to anticipate most of the dross and skip over to the next cleverly-crafted chunk of prose.\nAt a time when German politics is moving once again back towards the right-wing CDU and tubthumping---tired of the slow, careful movements of the pragmatic socialist Schnecken that have formed previous coalitions---Grass' novel-cum-memoir is an illuminating read: not so much of the current political climate, which has of course changed dramatically since then, but of the collective German psyche in the 20th Century. After leaping at one political movement and being stung to their psychic core, it somehow takes all of the German people's collective restraint not to leap at another. Ultimately, Grass asks us again and again the question: why must we always learn from the hare, the big cats, the hunters and the gods of myth and legend... but never from the snail?\n  \n    \n            \n                    From the Diary of a Snail        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Günter Grass        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Minerva        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/slow-slow-slow-slow-slow.html"},{"title":"Something from the security of every man's life","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Running Wild        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    J G Ballard        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Flamingo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, April 14, 2006, and on the ReadReverb website)\nThat the task of shocking people becomes more difficult over time is a truism borne out, broadly speaking, by the trajectories of popular culture: yesterday's X-rated films are today's ironic artefacts; the antics of Kenneth Williams or Joe Orton are now interesting commentaries on their time; and books whose themes were once wholly beyond the pale are now ripe for discussion at A level. Nonetheless, it's surprising to find that the disturbing plot twist of Running Wild, a foray by the iconoclastic Ballard into the world of the rich middle class, can be guessed halfway through the third page.\nWhen the inactive CCTV cameras of a secure estate near Pangbourne are the mute witnesses of the brutal, organized killing of all the adults, and the abduction of their children, the desperate denizens of the Home Office call in a maverick psychiatric adviser to solve a problem which months of departmental work couldn't crack. So far, so Lynda-La-Plante; but as the novella progresses it's clear that this particular suspense thriller is hardly Saturday-night ITV fare. Indeed, the book strikes to the heart of that genre's assumptions---all nonces are scum, the loose cannons are the true lawmakers, and if the guilty don't get their just desserts then they're at least verifiably guilty---and might cause the average viewer of The Bill to slam the book closed in horror, or at any rate write a jolly angry letter of complaint.\nUnfortunately, the catch for Ballard is that the audience that might be genuinely disturbed by this, a deep excursion into the farthest reaches of id similar to the terrible revenge wrought by Saki's Sredni Vashtar, are unlikely to read his books; those who appreciate a decent evening's account of the churning, shifting sands upon which civilization's trembling castle is built, on the other hand, are now so post-Paedogeddon that the writer needs to be either more subtle or more provocative than this. Even accounting for its age, this book was published at around the time when David Lynch was already exposing the rotten timber of the lower foot or two of America's white picket-fences; while it's far more approachable it's also less bizarre and less dangerous than other examples of the genre. The biggest shock, therefore, is how unshocking it really is.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Running Wild        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    J G Ballard        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Flamingo        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/something-security-every-mans-life.html"},{"title":"Something is squeezing my skull","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Doctor is Sick        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Norton        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nDiagnosed with a brain tumour, and given a year to live, Burgess set himself the task of posthumously supporting his wife through royalties: by writing, a lot. The result was patchy but prolific and, a year later and with no sign of actual physical death, he slowed down and improved a good deal: classics like A Clockwork Orange followed shortly afterwards. The Doctor is Sick is very much a workmanlike product of that long year, and in some ways one of the most thinly-veiled of Burgess' semi-autobiographical novels.\nTo list the coincidences: Edwin Spindrift, protagonist of The Doctor is Sick, has a brain tumour; he's a philologist, proficient in many languages and in linguistics generally; his wife is a borderline alcoholic—they both drink rather heavily—and their relationship is rather awkwardly open (mostly for her.) Spindrift's tumour necessitated a return from hotter climes, and the abandonment of a job he gradually realises is now utterly closed to him. He's even treated by a consultant who moonlights in the entertainment industry (Sir Roger Bannister conducted some of the tests on Burgess.) Later plot twists imply that Spindrift has never actually had a tumour at all—but then depending on whose story you read, neither did Burgess.\nThough it might seem churlish to simply recite the many aspects of Burgess' life which coincide with Spindrift's, it's in these details that the novel is at its most pedestrian. Spindrift's loss of libido is tied somehow to his inability to put emotional meaning to words, his stock in trade; with ironic similarity, Burgess' desire to rattle off a book nearly shoots itself in the foot, by paying too little attention to how much fun reading that book needs to be.\nOnly once Burgess has all his write-what-you-know in place can The Doctor is Sick really take off. And take off, modestly, is what it does. If Spindrift's tumour does exist, then denial goes a long way to keeping its effects at bay, as he absconds from hospital and is drawn by his wife's less salubrious acquaintances into a world of phantasmagorical vice. Is he really being fed smoked salmon by a kinky crime boss, and lecturing an illegal drinking-den on the development of slang in the Cockney dialect; or instead hallucinating, unconscious, during the decisive operation which might cure him? Nothing is entirely certain once Burgess makes himself let go. Is this novel a quirky retelling of the subjective expereience of illness, or a failed experiment in writing postcards from the edge? The jury, like the good doctor himself, has yet to return.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Doctor is Sick        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Anthony Burgess        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Norton        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1997)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/something-squeezing-my-skull.html"},{"title":"Talkin' 'bout my self","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Generation of Swine        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Hunter S Thompson        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWho knows what tomorrow brings? Political pundits ought to. Granted they rarely do, but then their collective mediocrity is no excuse for the individual self-proclaimed \"expert\". We need someone to give us surety, to tackle these problems head-on and tell us what will happen: tell us and nobody else, because only we are listening. We need what every generation needs: its Hunter S Thompson.\nIn this collection of his columns from the San Francisco Examiner, Thompson recounts his experiences in an era that Bill Hicks once likened to all the artists in America shooting darts into an enormous Republican elephant. He popularizes and explains tricky political and sporting issues impressively---as usual discussing Hunter S Thompson as much as he does current affairs---and spices up the stodgy analysis with vignettes from his eccentric personal life: his brief career in salvaging a beached yacht; the explosion of a home-made, car-sized bomb in the middle of the desert; and the claiming of a gold Mercedes as security on a bet, which he immediately trades for another car, so sure he is of the outcome.\nThompson is tired and out of sorts in this volume: like some Bowie space creature, he's far from his spiritual home of the 60s and 70s, and struggles to find his feet. The Democratic sands shift confusingly, Gary Hart's campaign crumbles to dust before he can even blink, and eventually nothing is certain. Not even football, as he finds himself pursued by the owner of the Mercedes as the bet turns sour.  Gambler to the core, Thompson is no better a seer of political futures than the next man, and in interpreting the odds, as in his writing and his inventiveness, HST has passed his prime.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Generation of Swine        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Hunter S Thompson        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/talkin-bout-my-self.html"},{"title":"A tangled web","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Silk        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alessandro Baricco        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £3.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Harvill Press        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1998)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe breeding of silkworms was once a secret closely guarded by a Japanese elite. Western traders, such as Hervé Joncour, would rarely be offered even the fertilized eggs; when they were, it would be strictly at a certain stage of gestation, and the race would be on to return before the eggs hatched. In such a manner does Joncour spend his days, following the trade routes to the Orient and back on a timescale of seasons and years. Then he finds himself falling in love with the conccubine of Hara Kei, his Japanese contact. His whole world is seized with a great tremor, and when the dust has settled nothing will be the same again.\nWhile writing Silk, Baricco probably had in mind that he was putting together a stylish novel; this self-consciousness has created a rather stylized one instead. The many quirks such as repetition and dwelling on details (the importance of which isn't immediately obvious) veer between being evocative to being annoying and back, passing through endearing on the way. More difficult to digest than that, though, is the lead character. Joncour is presented as a thoughtful, taciturn man: we are expected to believe that dark currents move beneath his show of repose. But none of them are ever really alluded to, still less rise above the waves. His emotional reactions are tangential: practically unemotional.\nA love story where, owing to narrative constraints, the central character could easily be autistic seems an ill-advised proposition. Indeed, it's difficult to engage at all with Silk on a human level. Still, the conceit of a Western novel told in the cadences and rhythms of Japanese poetry is an exciting one, and there are many set pieces---Joncour's journey across south-east Europe and Asia---that have a charm all of their own. If only the same could be said of the characters.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Silk        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alessandro Baricco        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £3.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Harvill Press        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1998)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/tangled-web.html"},{"title":"\"Tha mother's mad, tha knows.\"","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Jeanette Winterson        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1991)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb newsletter, Feb 3, 2006, and on the ReadReverb website)\nSo this is what Alan Bennett's been trying to do with those dreadful bloody Talking Heads all these years. Jeanette Winterson, with her debut novel, has managed to flesh out a rich, tortured, brittle, and above all Northern ageing lady in a way that Bennett never could. Poor Bennett, trying to recreate his mother, or at least rebuild his mother's shattered mind, while Winterson---and the main character is called Jeanette, notice---breezes through fluid gorgeous prose while fitting together a character both easy to construct and (well, she should be) impossible to convincingly maintain: a harridan, an interfering, self-righteous, bigoted, over-religious Protestant old baggage. But all the time, like the young narrator, you love this dreadful woman as much as you hate her.\nOranges are Not the Only Fruit is a novel about the  relationship between a young girl and her mother, as the former tries  desperately to become an adult and the latter foot-binding her with edicts  and passages from the Bible. None of the saints, though: God forbid. It  moves slowly and thematically through the life of the daughter, while the  mother tries her hardest to be constant and unyielding, not bending to the  looser, more liberal lifestyle her daughter is trying to adopt.\nThere's always a lot made about the sex, of course. The torrid antics of the main character, and the hints of it that occur in relation to the local sweetshop owners who, in the words of Mother, \"'dealt in unnatural passions.' I thought she meant they put chemicals in the sweets.\" But through subtle touches---photos disappearing overnight from old albums, hints of affairs that weren't just with Mother's \"downfall\" Pierre---all is linked back to Mother. Mother is the subject, and Jeanette is just a cipher, bringing her Mother to three-dimensional life, created by that Protestant God, almost solely in order to create Mother in turn for the  reader. Even in the deepest of despairs Jeanette seems resigned to her  fate: as the narrator she can see it coming. But her mother battles  on, against Satan and evil, against the fornicators next door and  under her very roof. The resignation springs from the knowledge that,  whatever Jeanette's story, her mother's must be told too.\nThere are faux-naive sections that cut with the main narrative and are intrusive, gauche and sluggish, and although they develop well through the book---moving from children's stories through to adolescent girls' stories---they are juxtaposed clumsily and suddenly, and thus jar with the harshness of Mother's reality. Ultimately the story is only ever at home in the imperialism of her laws that are not her laws, but what she hears every Sunday, learns from the pastor, picks up from her CB radio as she calls prayerfully into the night, \"This is Kindly Light calling Manchester... come in Manchester, this is Kindly Light\" and waits forever for the response.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Jeanette Winterson        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1991)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/tha-mothers-mad-tha-knows.html"},{"title":"Therefore, he speaks the truth","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Billy Liar        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Keith Waterhouse        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1970)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nBilly Liar is a fantasist. Trapped in the gauche, garish town of Stradhoughton and longing for escape to London, he invents a cast of characters and an alternative universe or two that gradually turn from comic to tragicomic. Billy is the narrator of his week-long trip, culminating---so he hopes---in a move to London to start writing comedy for Danny Boon, instead of shifting coffins for Shadrack and Duxbury. The real world encroaches on his every dream and fantasy, leaching them of colour, and Billy must fight for the rights to his delusional inner life.\nBilly Liar is also a nightmare to review. Iconic, over-analysed, a set text on many a syllabus... people who bought this item also bought A Kestrel for a Knave and Of Mice and Men. Cultural commentator Malcolm Bracewell raves over it in England is Mine. It sits at a turning-point in 20th century culture, post-war, where the cities have suddenly begun to encroach on the towns.  Not geographically, yet, but news and disaffected youth have brought the giddy buzz of London too close to Stradhoughton for comfort.   The metropolitan and the provincial chafe together, and Billy's frantic merrygoround life is fired up by the violence of this collision. Regional accents, and the words spoken in them, have begun to lose their sense to the new generation. Connections, Billy realizes, are being unmade as much as they are being made.\n Billy Liar's every step is dogged and sometimes revoked entirely by what he sees as threats to the way of life he wants to pursue. Shadrack, in Billy's estimation too small a man to keep him captive, tightens his grip all the same. The promotional calendars, never posted, Billy pushes around the countryside like Sysiphus' rock. And his childlike, innocent revelations to Liz are encroached upon by the smallness of Stamp and his idiot friends. These experiences make no sense as an aspirational journey; instead we should read it as a demonstration of the indefatigability of the human spirit, the meagre but dependable protection that his learning gives him throughout all of his trials. He's also thoughtful, compassionate---the final scenes with his grandmother and mother are heart-rending---and, in the final analysis, very funny indeed. That is, if there ever were a final analysis of Billy Liar.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Billy Liar        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Keith Waterhouse        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1970)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/therefore-he-speaks-truth.html"},{"title":"There's life in the old sea-dog yet","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Old Man and the Sea        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Ernest Hemingway        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nTo what extent can nature writing function as a novel form: that is, how can observing the natural world and man's interaction with it reveal to us the inner life of an individual? As the novel recovered from Victorian baroque only to be plunged into Joyce's gothic intricacies of the human condition, could a novelist dig deep yet still remain on the surface, in the empirical?\nSpanning as it did a period from the end of the first world war to after the middle of last century, Hemingway's entire oeuvre seems like a response to these questions. His direct, declarative style eschews any sort of internal viewpoints, even with the first-person narrative of For Whom The Bell Tolls, and yet it is the plainness and directness of his approach that is so powerful. In The Old Man and the Sea Hemingway's deliberately simple tools are at their keenest and smoothest, joining together perfectly to tell the story of an elderly fisherman on an epic odyssey, the trip that will either break his run of bad luck and no fish, or confirm it and reduce him effectively to a beggar. Three days at sea, and yet Hemingway takes only a hundred short pages to reveal to us every inch of the protagonist's humanity. By the end of the novel we live and breathe this old man, his fascination with baseball, his sore and bleeding hands, the core of indefatigability in his salt-dried soul.\nIn writing so powerfully and yet so plainly, Hemingway has confirmed that one needn't hear a character's unspoken words, or be told explicitly about their emotions, to understand them through their actions and reactions. The one rhetorical device he uses to plug the gaps is making the old man talk to himself---or, at any rate, to the great fish he fights---but even this is believable, within context.

Well, in Fry's case, his life might have been rather conventional, and sometimes dull in a middle-class way, were it not that he himself unintentionally, self-destructively, livened it up. Theft. Fraud. Abscondment. Pursuit by the law. A criminal record. Add in this mix an all-boy's public school, smatterings of sex, and the tortured writhings of an adolescent's soul, related by a literate, interesting, talented adult who writhes just as much in embarrassment: from its premise, Moab is my Washpot can only be either a harrowing car-crash of a read or a source of page after page of fascination.\nTo grow up anywhere in the vicinity of Fry's comedy and writing is to fall a little in love with his public persona: occasionally irritated, certainly, and tired at his relentless tweediness, but love, like public school's rather robust ersatz, sometimes hurts. We all want an evening with Stephen Fry, and this autobiography is exactly that. He talks, he reveals, he riffs and creates, tying his slightly unexciting toddlerhood to funny (although nowadays slightly hackneyed) observations on English culture, and relentlessly analysing (and largely castigating) his later actions. One gets the sense of the author sitting by one's side and telling the story: luckily, it's told so well that this only adds to the experience.\nOddly, for a pedant like Fry, there's an abundance of minor errors (in the 1997 edition) that even the most basic of proofreading would have discovered: missing vocative commas, commas in the places of full stops, the occasional clumsy or ambiguous sentence. It's almost as though he has indeed dictated it to an amanuensis, perhaps to deliberately develop the flavour of An Evening With Stephen Fry. Yet at least once he mentions he's typing it himself. Has he fallen victim to the post-proofing butchery of sub-editors, or is this really only a first draft, printed stet and off the cuff? If this is a first draft, we should all feel a pang of jealousy towards this genius---although he would balk and dissemble if so called---who is able to engage and entertain, for some four hundred pages without a break, with all the apparent ease of a don smoking a pipe in the senior common room.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Moab is my Washpot        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Stephen Fry        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Arrow        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/ticklish-delight.html"},{"title":"Time as a tool, not as a couch","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Cloud Atlas        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    David Mitchell        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Sceptre        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to praise Cloud Atlas: partly because so many others have; partly because it's so good. But you wonder how it came about: if short stories don't sell, is this a way of selling short stories? Unite them with a theme, as Arabian Nights does. That's a set of short stories with a concept, and in its time it's sold rather well. So, take a central conceit—a nested set of tales, each told by a character in another—and apply it to any anthology you like. You can fiddle with chronology, throw in a few arch cross-references, that sort of thing: but don't fix what isn't broken. EVen if you haven't improved the narratives, you've at least made a literary splash (potentially) and improved your chances of publishing a bankable product.\nIt's easy to disparage Cloud Atlas: partly because everyone else has gushed over it; partly because of its clever-clever premise. But you marvel at the diligence of that premise: each story contains the story in which it's being told, and although that thread seems tenuous at first, it gradually gains strength as the book proceeds. One story's character in some way—transmigration?—embodies the essence of someone in the containing story, which sounds weak but is in itself no more than something to hang a complex interplay of empathy and internal conflict off. Odd coincidences of name and inversions of cause and effect accumulate, as chronologically earlier stories remain unfinished for a time, drawing the reader in.\nIt's easy to read Cloud Atlas: partly because each short story is so well written; partly because all six work so well as a whole. But you worry at times that it might all collapse: the weight of form, briefly, threatens to squeeze the life out of the whole project. Then, at its heaviest, the form turns out to be so finely counterbalanced that instead it starts to pull on the flywheel of the readers engagement, running him faster and faster as each tale, on closing, retroactively polishes and perfects the others which had dependent on it. The preponderance of first-person narration n(an old trick) is the one hint that Mitchell had to pull out all the stops to pitch Cloud Atlas at the volume he wanted. But however hard he's worked to bring it about, ultimately for the reader it's all just so easy.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Cloud Atlas        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    David Mitchell        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Sceptre        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2004)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/time-tool-not-couch.html"},{"title":"Tough, tough reading","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Will Self        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1999)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nI wish I didn't like Will Self so much. I wish he wouldn't, for example, use \"gifted\" to mean \"given\" (although I tip my hat at him for using it when it's appropriate). And, while I'm wishing for improbables, can I wish for a Scalextric, some Space Lego, and a brand new set of  die-cast cars?\nThis collection of Self's stories takes its title from an advertising slogan for Tonka Toys. The appropriation of this and countless other chunks of pop target Self squarely at the demographic which twats on about Bagpuss and Roobarb and Custard.  Not, admittedly, at the vapid twenty-somethings whose mental processes start and stop with reciting a list of childhood TV references;  instead the psychological make-up of the Self fan is the thirty-something (in my case, late twenty-something---and besides, the reviewer is always exempt from his own generalisations) who sees Nirvana's greatest hits coming out and is gripped with fear. The hunt begins for something that both speaks on the wavelength of the contents-settled 30-year-old, and is still dangerous and avant-garde.\nSelf is normally reasonably dangerous, and bares his teeth frequently in Tough, Tough Toys.... As a social commentator he ranks with the unashamed like Chris Morris and Jeremy Hardy. But his insistence on tying his work to the stock-in-trade of the provocateur (eg. prison and drug slang, sounding hollow in the mouths of Tembe and Danny in the first and last stories; or the speed-freak in the eponymous story, compiled---like a Julie Burchill column---just to raise the hackles on the sensitive reader) knits hairline cracks into his work. Consequently bits of it (Dave Too, Design Faults in the Volvo 760 Turbo: A Manual) fall apart like the crumbly money-spinner in The Rock of Crack as Big as The Ritz. Self's writing, stripped of its bombast, vocabulary and cute references, is astonishingly variable for someone so accomplished. When it's good, it's the wry Story For Europe or bizarre, finely-turned sci-fi Caring, Sharing; when it's bad (most obviously Dave Too), it's a dribble of A-level standard  pseud, good writing if all you've ever read includes none of Self's  influences or contemporaries.\nA shame, then, that Self's best work is still his debut The Quantity Theory of Insanity. Occasionally the newer stories, in here and anthologies such as Grey Area, reach as high as his first efforts. But you could easily edit most of his work since that smashing beginning into a single book, all of it tight and astonishing.

Arrested for a crime committed by his imaginary twin brother, he is employed by Cardinal Richelieu's successor as a spy on the sailing ship Amaryllis. Here he must discover the method employed by the Englishman Dr Byrd to determine longitude at sea, the great navigational problem of the age. With the discovery made Roberto is flung from the ship during a storm which wrecks it; after a week at sea he comes to rest against the bows of a second ship, moored within sight of the dateline, and the island beyond it. There, on that island, is the secret of longitude; more importantly the island is by its location yesterday itself, a yesterday that, if only Roberto could reach it, would permit him to make right the wrongs he has suffered.\nBut Roberto is not alone on the boat. Who dogs his footsteps? Who feeds the menagerie of birds, reminiscent of the specimens of natural history that Byrd collected on the Amaryllis as a cover story? Who winds up the collection of clocks, and why would this second ship---the Daphne---contain a room full of those mechanisms? Marooned, forgotten about, desolate... Roberto begins to write down his thoughts, a conflation of his own history and present with the Machiavellian adventures of brother Ferrante, leading inexorably to a present he wishes to deny in fiction if not in fact.\nThis swashbuckling epic, with battle scenes in Casale and mental and physical duelling in the salons of Paris, almost turns its own pages at a fair rate. Eco's encyclopaedic knowledge rarely interrupts the flow of a fascinating story, and often---like in Name of the Rose---seeks to compliment the events portrayed. His expertise in semiotics, moreover, leads to a subtle but effective mirroring of each textual item in every neighbour. His desire for Lilia, lonely---or comforted by Ferrante?---in Paris, is transfigured into the unattainable island, while the island and the boat are the images of fabled Ferrante and concrete Roberto. Or is Ferrante himself merely a symbol of Roberto's own downfall? And everywhere there are dissimilar twins: twin brothers, twin islands, twin boats, twin spies, twin methods of navigation. Which comes first, which means which?\nUltimately, however, the winding of the memoirs of Roberto around a literary caprice twists the story too crooked to be believable any longer, as a story. Eco is playing with, among other things, the notion of \"who writes the writer?\" skipping from the narrator, putative discoverer of Roberto's scribblings, to Roberto and thence to Ferrante and back. And by God he leaves you in no doubt that's what he wants to do. His fun-poking at the expense of critics and criticism takes the sting out of the tale, leaving it anticlimactic and as bifurcated as his larded symbolism. Clearly, although we will always need a star as bright as Eco to steer the modern novel by, one of him is more than sufficient.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Island of the Day Before        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Umberto Eco        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Minerva        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/walking-backwards-christmas-island.html"},{"title":"A want becomes a have","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Angela Carter        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1990)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nHoffman has used his inverted, mystical science to conjure up angels and demons from the hearts of men, unleashing them in their world: every wish is granted, yet the streets run red with blood. Seeing his isolated civilization threatened, the Minister makes a spy of unassuming Desiderio, and releases him into the outside world. Desiderio must find and, ultimately, outwit the scheming doctor, hateful as the old academic is of reason and wishing, frighteningly to free man from what he sees as its chains.\nAlways the desired, so rarely the desirer, Desiderio is somehow immune to the charms of the hallucinations Hoffman creates. Only Hoffman's daughter, appearing in dreams and undreams, could ever sway his heart and bring him to his destiny in Hoffman's mountain lair. His route takes him over an ever-shifting landscape, with characters that are as good as hallucinations when they're not actually so: Hoffman's mentor-turned-servant, with a sideshow fashioned magically from miniature desire machines; the dozen acrobats who dissect themselves harmlessly in front of a live audience, but who are far more dangerous to Desiderio; earthquakes; boat people; horse people; and, the most dangerous of all, real, normal people who happen also to have machine guns and helicopters.\nAngela Carter's fine grasp of fairytales (both the corpus and the techniques thereof), and of a subtle, childlike wonder that shows faux-naivety up for the cheap trick that it is, works lyrical wonders with this novel, layering it with reality's bluffs and counter-bluffs. A dreamlike fog pervades throughout, in which we cannot trust Desiderio's senses, nor the directions in which Desiderio's wants---or ours, for that matter---might take us next. If the narrative lacks bite, then the book is built to be rich and satisfying, the action melodramatic and self-effacing so that the next beautiful, impossible scene might unfold. Disclaiming even as it makes claims, Carter's own creation draws you in, and convinces you that her world is only as unreal as any other.\nWhen Eco writes a novel where every single symbol has a special significance, or many such significances, you know you're in for a difficult read. Not so with Angela Carter, who seems able to throw every meaning she likes at a plot, to find every single one of them sticking.

The standard McSweeney's article is:  self-referential; desperately earnest; overflowing with slightly intrusive format tricks e.g. lists and parody after parody of official documentation; and laced with bizarre dialogue that out-DeLilloes DeLillo at every turn, Pinter on acid, Beckett on weak tea. Worryingly, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (in line with every other critic, and the book itself, we proceed to shorten this to AHWOSG) begins in this very manner, with the foreword \"THIS WAS UNCALLED FOR\" preceding a de/reconstruction of the generic book copyright page. In the appendix, included in later editions upside down and running backward from the last physical page of the book, this very reconstruction is itself deconstructed in an attempt to disclaim any kind of ironic sneering behind such fiddling.  Confused? Well, you could do worse than follow Eggers' handy \"Rules and Suggestions for the Enjoyment of this Book\" and just plough straight into the story proper. Worse includes succumbing to the eye-rolled desire to catapult this apparently annoying, quirky, self-effacing, multi-tiered irony cake across the room.\nWhy, given the above description of the book, could wanging the damn thing out of the window be ill-advised? Well, once all the early faffing and posturing is disposed of, the book proper is just beautiful. Eggers' limited success in his attempts to come to terms with the deaths of both of his parents from cancer (of which the book itself is one, a point which becomes clear to the reader shortly before Eggers hammers it home with one of the blissfully few intrusive McSweeneyisms in the book, but by that point he's almost forgiven before he has begun, the pleading of his narrative fitting seamlessly with the pleading of his stylish tricks) is told with frankness and a good, healthy dose of emotion---neither impersonal nor dripping with sickly tears.\nHis dialogue is spot on, largely reconstructions from memory. The careful interweaving of the life and death of Might Magazine, an anti-, or maybe post-Face publication, with slow deaths, near deaths and half-deaths provides an ideal matrix to set the story onto, the literary equivalent of the matrix Eggers pleads for, sometimes feels, is sometimes cut adrift from. And maybe you can forgive all of the unnecessaries---where Eggers painstakingly explains the act of negotiation in dialogue reconstruction as if it hadn't been the subject of plenty of  novel-gazing in the past, or includes a partial table of symbolism in the story, as if no author had ever drawn such a table up before.\nYou can forgive all of this because Dave, his brother Toph, Beth, Shalini, Moodie, all the staff at Might, Sari the sexologist... they're all so young, and their youth gives them power to hurtle through the presages of death and old age.  Look what we can do, the text says. We are amazing, the narrative says. We are unstoppable, says the whole, the author; the arc of this genuinely loveable piece of hubris as it aims squarely for the sun; Toph's frisbee, flung out by the sheer joy of being young and perfect and coiled like a spring; a blithe Icarus, climbing and climbing....\n  \n    \n            \n                    A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Dave Eggers        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Picador        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2001)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/we-are-amazing-unstoppable.html"},{"title":"A' we luve 's been dung ajee","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Stevenson Under the Palm Trees        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alberto Manguel        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £163.00,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    5.99, Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson spent the last few years of his life on a Samoan island. Like many literary exiles, during that period he was both prolific and wracked with doubts as to his abilities. But what if he had travelled all those thousands of miles, only to meet a sinister spiritual twin? When Mr Baker, a Scottish Puritan, appears on the beach one evening barking bible verse and eschewing the somewhat indolent lifestyle of the native islanders, Stevenson finds his presence curious if unremarkable to others. But then the violence begins. And the rape. And, ultimately, the killing. Stevenson is implicated---or was it Mr Baker? Does Baker even exist, or is Stevenson much sicker than he thinks? How to solve the mysteries, before the community turns against the author and embarks on a course of retribution that Stevenson might, or might not, deserve?\nStevenson Under the Palm Trees, in the style of the more successful fictionalizing homages to great authors, is a spicy, redolent novella, written with illuminating affection rather than oppressive devotion. It slots very neatly, in fact, into gaps in Stevenson's oeuvre: those he didn't have chance to fill, describing Samoa and the colourful background of his own situation; and those he could never fill, consisting of dramatizations of his final days and moments. However, Stevenson himself is very much a prop, far less psychologically developed than his weird doppelgänger or than any of Stevenson's own fictional characters, and he neither bungles nor strides his way through the criminal investigations that provide a structure for the book, but rather drifts along as the plot demands. This novella gives clues to his influences, his surroundings and his ultimate death: it would be a fitting tribute to his writing---a veritable pastiche---if it had also told us more about the man himself.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Stevenson Under the Palm Trees        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Alberto Manguel        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £163.00,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    5.99, Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/we-luve-s-been-dung-ajee.html"},{"title":"We say we love flowers, yet we pluck them","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Crimson Petal and the White        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Michel Faber        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £9.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nWalking into a room of your house, or climbing or descending the stairs, only to have to pause in complete forgetfulness of what you intended to do there, is generally considered to be a sign of encroaching old age or simple-mindedness; or both. It suggests a level of distraction that's humourous to watch but puzzling and sometimes upsetting to endure. And while watching someone dither so can be entertaining, being watched while you yourself dither is just embarrassing. So you can imagine how foolish someone might feel if they wrote a whole novel in a similarly aimless manner.\nThe Crimson Petal and the White, an 800-page doorstop of a novel, is Michel Faber's grand compendium of narrative senior moments. Ostensibly its faux-Victorian trudge through an excessively factual nineteenth-century England aims at the genre of Dickensian morality tale, but hoping to encompass the full range of human interaction at that time, not baulking at examining the very lowest levels of society and intercourse that Dickens—for all his portrayals of street-sweepers—could only ever allude to. Ultimately, though, Faber's novel only shares one aspect with Dickens' work—its length—an aspect unwarranted by the quality of the subject matter under discussion.\nFaber begins with a chummy, garrulous narrator that seems to sit on the shoulder of the prostitute Sugar as she begins to lift herself out of her profession. This voice is probably intended to expose with sympathy and ironic moral excoriation the misery of every sexual detail, but it ends up sounding like the sinister, pawing uncle of every whore mentioned in the novel. But he quickly abandons this oddly leering interlocutor, occasionally lapsing back into it accident, when the action flags and Faber needs an omniscient presence to relate the characters' thoughts. Only when Uncle Leery returns for good to tell us about the fall of the house of Rackham do we realize that it's a standard bookending device, and we're on the home stretch.\nIn between we get all the cloacal, genital and medical details of the surprisingly few main characters: only half a dozen core personalities, with perhaps two dozen hangers-on; a lack of complexity put to shame by the very genre Faber wants to pastiche. The information is relentless, until we're quite fed up of what becomes crashingly dull and nauseating honesty, meant to convince us that this is a no-holds barred exploration of humanity in all of its gritty etcetera.\nMeanwhile, some people die for no clear narrative reason; some nearly die but don't; some are charmingly stereotypical, like a sort of perverted Mrs Malaprop; some have dreams which come to fruition; some have dreams which don't; some have a kind of pitiable depth of feeling that goes nowhere and achieves nothing. Eventually, most of the main characters fade away, leaving Faber with a final chapter like a sentence finished at a comma; he terminates everything mid-plot, as if he too is quite bored with the story; or perhaps as if he had put the manuscript down, wandered off into another room, and then quite forgotten about it. It's a shame the publishers never did the same.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Crimson Petal and the White        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Michel Faber        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £9.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Canongate        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/we-say-we-love-flowers-yet-we-pluck-them.html"},{"title":"What are they like?","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Persuasion        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Jane Austen        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £1.50,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Wordsworth        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThat Austen is now famous for her romantic plots is a tribute to her ability to make the events of apparently superficial lives so exciting;   that she isn't more famous for her irony, an astringent on the ego of the reader, owes much to the touting of the costume-drama friendly Pride and Prejudice, with its interchangeable Bennet sisters, over Persuasion and its subtle and slow-burning wit.\nA satire in all but its position in bookshops, this novel chronicles the attempts by its protagonist, Anne Elliot, to undo the deeds of her earlier, more impressionable self. At the advice of her friend Lady Russell and her father Sir Walter (both revealed as silly and petty), she had broken off an engagement with Captain Wentworth, who returns years later in different circumstances, yet no more welcomed by Anne's confidants. Less chick-lit and more a readable Vanity Fair, its sprawl tidied and checked, this novel critiques and lampoons the very characters who consider themselves decisive, moral and wise, yet mark themselves as fair game for such mockery through their actions, preferences and muddle-headed advice.\nStandard Austenisms abound: multiple witnesses with multiple opinions; garrulous females and bluff servicemen; and a whiff of farce in the tortuous human relationships. Yet all the while that she strips her  characters down to their social stereotypes, Austen displays such  affection for them: tough love, disguised as deferential, throwaway  remarks. This love prevents her criticisms from becoming callous, and  strengthens her admonishment of her most foolish characters.\nAusten put much of herself into this, her last novel: her dislike of the social whirl in Bath, the regrets of the early 19th Century twentysomething, her smothering mother. And a string of infirmities---a blow to the head, a kick from a horse---hints at the consumption which finally claimed Austen's life. Yet it's too easy to draw these parallels, and forget the true delight of Persuasion:  every emperor finally stripped naked, divested of their new clothes, and only Wentworth and Elliot earning their figleaves and returning, prodigal and repentant, to their Eden.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Persuasion        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Jane Austen        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £1.50,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Wordsworth        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1993)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/what-are-they-emlikeem.html"},{"title":"What can be done with less","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Borderliners        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Peter Høeg        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Panther        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nExistence on the borders of normality gives three institutionalized children singular viewpoints of how the rest of society works. Peter arrives at Biehl's academy, at the end of a journey through orphanages and \"homes\" which has left him secretly, quietly scarred. In a halting, jumpy narration he explains how he meets fellow borderliner Katarina, and is put in charge of August (an aberration whose disruptive, violent presence at the school Peter can scarcely credit). As he probes deeper into the relationship between the school and its charges, Peter seems to uncover a conspiracy that strikes at the heart of every good Cartesian's avowed disinterest: time itself, it seems, is being used to enslave and reshape children's minds.\nPeter's eccentric view is that children are being bound with time (or rather, Time) into the system of the academy, and thus normalized for their emergence into the outside world. But this is fatally undermined by his own descent into a fever that seems to have crept up on him while his attentions were diverted towards this phantasmal threat. His conclusions can hardly be unrelated to the upset to his powers of reasoning. Yet Peter is clearly involved in what he sees as a fight to the death with Time, and the jerky, piecemeal retelling of the story is both Høeg's literary device and Peter's ultimate weapon against linearity. His fragmented personality is trying to escape its own limitations, and the pain of his reminiscences, by reassembling his experiences at the academy together in this cryptic, roundabout way. In its prevarications might be seen to owe as much to Laurence Sterne as to Ken Kesey.\nBorderliners can be read as a Romantic treatment of how the label of \"damaged\" often precedes real harm to the individual's soul, or as an indictment of the operation of certain tiers of the welfare state, or even as a story of suspense, as Peter searches for the mystical, magical secret at the heart of the academy but stumbles across a more prosaic, grubby one. It more or less works on each of these levels. But while continuing to entertain and grip the reader, it's hampered by certain consequences of its nonlinear style. At times it reads like a well-constructed, neatly-seamed story, that has somehow been allowed to relax and unravel slightly before publication: the narrative is giving a little, like seams under strain. Gaps are easily bridged, however, and the archness with which flashbacks are forever partial and obfuscated doesn't dispel the urge to follow Peter down all the subsided, rubble-strewn pathways he takes; to revisit with him the maze in which he found himself and has attempted to escape, a maze that somehow exists without ever having been planned or built.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Borderliners        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Peter Høeg        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £6.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Panther        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1996)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/what-can-be-done-less.html"},{"title":"What a terrible mess we've gotten in","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Laughing Gas        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    P.

Both are to have a tooth out, and both find themselves under general anaesthetic in adjoining surgeries. But Reggie wakes up horrified to find that he and young Cooley have somehow swapped bodies during the otherwise routine clinical process of tooth extraction. Cooley, he soon finds out, is bolting around the place in the bulky body of the aristocrat bopping the noses of people he hates, and the police are gradually forming a pattern, while the Earl is prisoner to Joey's curls, his miserable schedule of pranks and public appearances, and the curtailment of his adult activities by the formidable Miss Brinkmeyer and the surprisingly sinister aspect of his fiancée, April June. As the scales fall from his eyes he soon realises: he needs to get out, get his body, and get back to England.\nWodehouse spends much of the brazenly hackneyed Laughing Gas perversely turning his own techniques inside out: a rescue attempt aided by the apparently friendly butler ends in a failure that Jeeves could never conscience; the lead character ends up (apologies for spoiling what plot there is) engaged, albeit not to the quite obvious disaster he sets out to court. Moreover, he happily shatters some of the golden rules of farces. To keep up the pace, they ought to resort to high-speed, physical dynamics. Characters hare around, fall over, drop into the shrubbery, are chased by thundering, brachiating Spodes. However, Wodehouse has prevented himself from resorting to such literal speed increases, as the Earl is frequently trapped against his adult will by Cooley's guardians. The result is a very stationary novel, compared to Jeeves & Wooster, or even to the Blandings series.\nIn places this static method works: the tension of the Earl bouncing off the walls, as Cooley in the Earl's body bounces his fist off his erstwhile oppressors with gleeful, childish and increasingly illegal abandon, coils and uncoils like a spring, keeping the story moving even when the Earl does not. But frequently it feels as though Wodehouse's usually powerful stroke of farce is treading water. The great strength of Wodehousian fiction lies in the author's ability to tell a cracking story, with sparkling characters, in which nothing actually very much happens; that the lack of plot is almost the point, or that the plot has a lack of a point. But plot is not the same as activity, any more than steel girders or a network of lead counterweights are like popping, fizzing champagne. The moral behind the relative flatness of Laughing Gas is: if you're not accomplishing anything, it's best to look busy.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Laughing Gas        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    P.

The immortal gesture runs through her like a brief shock of current, making its own journey from the past to the future, and the realisation leads Kundera, sat on the poolside, to fabricate the lady's life, and the lives of her closest relatives and friends, around the movement. Kundera suddenly finds himself caught up his own story's intricacies, talking to its characters and orchestrating silly, capricious dialogues between dead Goethe and dead Hemingway, all the time attempting to grasp the unperishable essence that permeates the decay of his characters.\nThis is a novel which quietly, without the fuss of avant-gardeism, takes apart the standard novel form: for example, it ends with an extended chapter which shares almost no plot with the rest of the book, preceded by the author acknowledging this very fact to one of his creations. And the core of Immortality is a set of short, disjointed vignettes starring the gesturing Agnes and her sister Laura, whose differences and similarities generate much of the book's content.\nIndeed, this casual playing fast and loose with the medium's mores is both the the book's strength and its weakness: no other form could probably have suited the content, but it makes it, oddly, simultaneously a difficult but frivolous read. The reader has finally got a grip on the purpose and meanings behind this slippery, complex story when it shifts scene and atmosphere, and it's asking a lot for him to keep up with Kundera's own vision.\nKundera is considered to be a proponent of magical realism, but Immortality's blurred boundaries are a relatively tame example of the genre. Nonetheless, the ease with which he can slip into his own story, and become emotionally entangled with its characters, illuminates the breadth of his talents. Kundera is fiction's Oliver Sacks, performing the same sort of fluid motions from the specific to the general: whereas Sacks starts from severe trauma seen in a clinical light, Kundera's examples are banal quotidians, whose oddity arises from the angle at which he chooses to look at them.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Immortality        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Milan Kundera        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Faber        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2000)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/when-i-make-sign-youll-wake.html"},{"title":"A whole lie is a half-truth","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Baudolino        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Umberto Eco        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nAttempting the memoirs of a self-confessed liar, from his own testimony alone, sounds like a fool's errand. But if that man's verbal fabrications had given birth to a city, a kingdom and the holy grail, then one might be inclined to treat them with respect. Besides, Baudolino's first act towards the Byzantine scholar Niketas Choniates was one of righteous Christian compassion during the sack of the city, and that in itself granted the Italian---pilgrim, fighter, peasant, tactician, most favoured of the late Holy Roman Emperor and slayer of his killer---weeks of audience with the fussy old Greek. Together they try to make sense of Baudolino's epic of mendacity, stacking and hammering fib against tall tale, to see what parts of it, if any, will support their own weight.\nEco himself has built on much of this territory before, several times and with variable success. The intricate, academic tomfoolery of Foucault's Pendulum imagined a suddenly real group of illuminati out of the interwoven fancies of three biblophiles; in doing so it brilliantly skewered every wannabe secret society and conspiracy theorist. Less successfully (insofar as a novel should be enjoyable) The Island of the Day Before chroncled travels of nautical and magical-realist compass, attempting to satirize literary hand-waving and intellectual shiftiness by comparison with his protagonist's shape-shifting world. And The Name of the Rose was a wordy, complex but ultimately rewarding evocation of the sights and smells of medieval Europe. With such fertile ground still arguably available to be measured and levelled for re-use, Eco might be excused for taking the premise of the first, the plot arc of the second, and the setting of the third; to construct like some hybridized Casaubo-bert-adso-dolino, a tall tale from these ruins and relics.\nAll the more reason to look favourably on Eco, to treat Baudolino as a grand autotextualization of his past work rather than merely a rehash, is that the novel is charming, funny and above all (given his past mistakes) readable: knockabout and bawdy yet erudite and deep, thoughtfully planned yet artfully clumsy in its layers of witty and sometimes affecting irony. Baudolino is a Blackadder of his time---just as clever, and just as stupid---and his chronicle, in a just world, would shrug off all attempts to label it as another clever-clever Eco work, and stand tall and proud among other period pseudobiographies such as Don Quixote or Tristram Shandy.\nEco clearly feels most at home at a certain point of Western scholarly development, and it's Baudolino's setting at this very juncture that gives it its power: Rose is set not long after, and Foucault's Pendulum arguably obtains much of its narrative and magical powers from dipping into the medieval melting-pot. For it's at this point in history when history itself is discovered, and scholars begin writing with one eye to posterity; yet, in the absence of any existing canon of chronicling (and therefore no guiding style) the result is an anarchic crashing-together of fiction, religious allegory, myth, mistakes, natural philosophy and genuine attempts at detached histories.\nIn this confusion Eco can easily insert Baudolino, son of the mythical saviour of Eco's birthplace; the young man and his college mates write the first letter \"from\"  Prester John; their travels take them to lands inhabited by Nurembergian monsters such as skiapods and blemmyae; there are hints of inventions steampunked out of their own era; and Emperor Frederick's natural death becomes murder. Eco even lets a blind philosopher Paphnutius vaguely predict Eco himself, as a greater liar than Baudolino who will one day write the tale that (the onetime real person) Niketas is reluctant to transcribe. Eco is clearly in his element, and the playfulness of his prose in Baudolino suggests a whole new writer, or at any rate a new translator (not so, though: it's admirably rendered into English by William Weaver). One can only hope that, with The Island behind him, Eco acknowledges his own strengths and weaknesses, and continues to have such obvious fun while writing such subtle books.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Baudolino        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Umberto Eco        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2003)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/whole-lie-half-truth.html"},{"title":"Why have birds and sing yourself?","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Birdsong        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Sebastian Faulks        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1994)        \n        \n\n\n\n\n(This review appeared in the ReadReverb  newsletter, Jan 20, 2006, and on the ReadReverb website)\nPutting together a book about the Great War, for a half-decent writer, is easy money. The material speaks for itself. Almost every single soldier's story contains enough joy, misery, fear, horror, excitement and feelgood spirit to be more than worth reciting. With authorial interference no greater than that of the proofreader or editor (and careful sequencing to highlight the irony of a modernist society, so willing to accept its own belief in ever-improving quality of life, which found itself facing such a horror) one can tug any reader gently from one end of a book of such stories to the other.\nIn this spirit it seems almost pointless to mention the plot of Birdsong. Taciturn, laconic Captain Stephen Wraysford struggles through battles backlit by a tragic love affair that occurred around the same geographical region, while men get their heads shot off or drag the cheese-decayed bodies of their dead brothers out of no man's land to give them a decent burial. Indeed, where Birdsong abandons all pretence of book-length structure, and lets itself be yet another collection of war yarns, it works tremendously well. To be fair to the love story of the protagonist, when left to its own emotional devices, it too has equal power to stir the reader to tears and smiles. By comparison, the contemporary love story that attempts to parallel Wraysford's experiences and give structure to the history that unfolds throughout the book is not at all engaging, and can be completely discarded without affecting the rest.\nBut where Faulks contributes what feels like his own content to this body of myth, he comes utterly unstuck. The limit of Faulks' power to intellectualize seems to be circumscribed by such banal received ideas as a church being nothing but a giant \"memento mori\", and Wraysford feeling a mixture of---gosh!---condescension and envy at the faith that supports the congregation. At these times it's almost as though the Tommies would prefer for Faulks to keep the hell out of it, and instead be a conduit for the stories which they can tell perfectly well (just as they used Erich Maria Remarque or Timothy Findley, both incidentally far more talented writers than Faulks). Every time Faulks chips in with his own observations, you can't help feel that he should've aired them some modern-day newspaper column, instead of managing to foul the already dirty, fecund air of '14--'18 Amiens. An enjoyable, readable book, though; no thanks to its author.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Birdsong        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Sebastian Faulks        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Vintage        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1994)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/why-have-birds-and-sing-yourself.html"},{"title":"Winter is slumber and sprung is rhythm","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Snow        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Orhan Pamuk        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Faber        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nPoets ought to be be first against the wall when revolution comes. In Snow, ominously, Turkey's favourite export/exile is visiting the tiny border town of his youth when an apocalyptic fall of snow precipitates a bloody take-over by romantic Republicans; yet he alone is most able to deal with the machinations and demands of the one-time actor who leads the revolutionary forces. While all he wants to do is marry his childhood sweetheart İpek and carry her back to Frankfurt, poor Ka finds himself negotiating with Blue, the outlawed Muslim \"terrorist\" and lover of İpek's sister, covering the spate of suicides of young headscarved women, and performing his poetry immediately prior to the bloody coup, the details of which recall the theatre siege in Moscow back in 2002. Suddenly it's not enough that Ka should leave the town happy and in love; he must ensure he is alive and well at the same time.\nThe task Pamuk has set himself is to blend politics, poetry and religion in the same novel. Far more novelists have failed than have succeeded in this task in the past; in a sense, like the axes of the snowflake Ka uses to construct his nineteen-pointed book of poems, these three topics seem to shun each other's company, especially nowadays that religion seems scarcely a subject on which one might wax lyrical and yet be scared of making political. But we needn't worry. Snow is a wonderful book, missing its central pivot of Ka's last writings but, as if to compensate, studded with gems of \"found\" poetry, often of great significance when measured against the religious and political upheavals in Kars. Pamuk brings some of these closer to our attention in chapter titles: \"Do they have a different God in Europe?\" \"It is not poverty that brings people like us close to God.\"  \"The difference between love and the agony of waiting.\"\nWith the geometry and symmetry inherent in each snowflake, Pamuk has crafted a novel of such balance and poise that it occasonally treads the fine line between intricacy and affectation. His characters make complex pronouncements---often in an apparently simplistic way, like country folk dispensing their rough-hewn, doubt-at-your peril wisdom---but this manages in a sense to communicate the non-western aspects of life in Kars rather than undermine the realism of the story. Ka accretes a web of politicking and intrigue that informs both his poetry and his plans for a future with İpek. The symbiotic dance of media and the small societies it influences and is influenced by is accurately and cleverly choreographed, with the preprinted papers deciding on one future, Ka another, yet often a third, subtler plot twist undermining them both.\nEven in translation, where we lose such hints as the assonance in Ka/kar/Kars/karmak (the poet's name/snow/the town's name/to mix or shuffle) the links and allusions are still rich and rewarding. It's impossible to overestimate the sheer number of details which Pamuk presses together in this book:  it's a timely novel, reminiscent in its ponderous, beautiful structures of Chekhov or Dostoevsky; or, perhaps more appositely, the unique six-sided fractals that permeate the novel.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Snow        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Orhan Pamuk        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £7.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Faber        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (2005)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/winter-slumber-and-sprung-rhythm.html"},{"title":"Wish you weren't here","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Collected Short Stories        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1986)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nThe vast expanse of fabled Greeneland, where it's traditionally believed Graham Greene takes us in his best work: does it really exist insofar as fictional worlds can? Has it a coherence and identity that establishes it as a subtle retelling of our own reality, a shift in perspective comparable to noir or Pynchon and Dick's vast holism of conspiracy and shifting truths?\nThis collection of short stories goes some way to answering that question. Sadly, that answer is: yes and no; or rather, Greeneland stories are easy to spot, and the others are in a world of their own. A complex, uncommonsensical morality pervades all the suspect stories, a paralysis that leaves the characters unable to connect or to perceive the reality of people's actions, blinded by the fog of their well-meaning. There is frequently a lonely, harassed protagonist (A Chance for Mr Lever, Jubilee) who is put upon by circumstance (Dream of a Strange Land, May We Borrow Your Husband?, Doctor Crombie). Morality, duty and compassion come into conflict and often open warfare (almost all the above, plus The Basement Room, Mortmain and Men at Work). All the ingredients of Greeneland are present in detectable if occasionally meagre concentrations.\nBut what's most interesting is Greene's sideline in entirely un-Greeneish fiction. Two equally sinister (but a little similar) stories about the undead take Greeneland dread and horror and apply it to an entirely different genre. A Drive in the Country transplants Brighton Rock methodology into Ken Loach's territory. Comedies and satires like Awful When You Think Of It, A Shocking Accident and Beauty hit the reader with some force, although the usual sense of suspicion and dread pervade even these. It's a joy to discover the science-fiction tale of A Discovery in the Woods, powerful and resonant with all the fears of the past century, a coda to Walter M. Miller's A Canticle for Liebowitz.\nIrritatingly, many stories have minor flaws which often go unnoticed on the first reading. Cheap in August seems primarily to have been given its title so that it might have a snappy ending, entirely out of keeping with the rest of the story. A Chance For Mr Lever ends clumsily and blockily, its use of karma and the irony of unknown events not really carrying the conviction of the writer, let alone convincing the reader. And the na gCopaleen-esque Under the Garden unravels all too quickly. These niggles aside, the 37 stories in this one volume represent a rare treat. Each one is a page-turner, regardless of Greene's occasional, apparent lapses of writerly judgment. This is Greeneland and Greeneland's precursors, true: but this is also a postcard sent by Greeneland on holiday and, true to form, away is no more secure a place than home.\n  \n    \n            \n                    Collected Short Stories        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Graham Greene        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    £8.99,        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Penguin        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1986)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/wish-you-werent-here.html"},{"title":"You don't have to be well-read to write here, but it helps","body":"\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    The Comforts of Madness        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Paul Sayer        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n            \n                    Sceptre        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n\n\n\nTelling a story from the point of view of someone already dead is an established literary device: The Lovely Bones is one of the more recent examples of books using it. But in The Comforts of Madness Paul Sayer develops the (arguably) politically equivalent of having as his narrator the effectively dead, a catatonic who can't communicate at all, but is merely receptive to the treatment he receives at the hands of others. And what bizarre treatment it is! From the woeful neglect of a hospital ward he's moved to an experimental treatment centre which does its best to break him and reshape him. As the attempts to bring him out of his trance force him to retreat emotionally and mentally, the book hurtles along to its harrowing climax.\nThe book charts Peter's descent through the mental health system. It's a kind of histrionic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, hammering home the message that our treatment of the mentally ill is often based on a Foucauldian imposition of our will rather than any consideration of the patient's wishes or interests. Unlike in Ken Kesey's work, here every dial is turned up to its maximum voltage, and the activities of the custodians and guardians are genuinely disturbing: so disturbing, though, that the book rapidly loses any power to shock as a portrayal, however extreme, of genuine conditions. The lunatics may well have taken over asylum in alternative-therapy trials, but they've done it by not acting like lunatics, at any rate not in a way that would prompt the layman to boggle quite so much at them. Sayer is unable to capture the subtleties that might make such inversions seem feasible.\nFrom the beginning, moreover, the book is hopelessly overwritten. One might excuse Peter's internal monologue being one big trawl through a thesaurus, as a compensation for his inability to express himself. But it slowly becomes clear that everyone speaks in a laboured, convoluted, delicate, and often highfalutin manner: from our narrator to hospital porters to consultants and the mentally disturbed army major. This is a book that has been not writ but wrought, hour after hour, pummeled and hammered in an attempt to fashion it into a tool for a very specific job;   instead, it has ended up merely flat and flimsy. In its convoluted, inescapable misery, The Comforts of Madness could be lazily tagged as \"Kafkaesque\". But it's easy to forget that Kafka would always place at the centre of his work a tough kernel of mockery, pouring forth stoic laughter in the face of the absurdity that he saw everywhere else. Only when one reads this book---the equivalent of Kafka with that core torn out of it---does one begin to appreciate the relative levity and relief that it would otherwise afford.\n  \n    \n            \n                    The Comforts of Madness        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Paul Sayer        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    OOP        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    Sceptre        \n        \n\n\n    \n            \n                    (1988)        \n        \n\n","href":"review/you-dont-have-be-well-read-write-here-it-helps.html"}]
